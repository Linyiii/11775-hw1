<#s> hey it's dot com and this video clip i'm going to show you a lower body workout focuses on and the so the major muscle groups were gonna be training here are the legs the lower back and the the first exercising workouts is uh i have this set up here in a power rack and amusing aerobics that for my box and this is this one is set up for twelve inches high which is just slightly below parallel for me and when i was down to the one thing you notice as you can further than you would if you were just doing like regular squats without sitting on a box in fact machines slightly so they're actually passed vertical here and again this would not be possible if you were doing regular squats because you're literally fall back over but the benefit of doing this is that works the hips hamstrings a lot more and actually places less stress on the knee joint so that's one of the advantages of doing the next exercise moving out to is lying leg curls this is a great exercise to really target hamstrings when i do this exercise i try to lift as explosive as hard as possible will still maintaining good exercise for the reason for this is that the hamstrings are primarily fast which muscle fibers and they respond to explosive type the train

the next exercise moving out to after leg curls is high risk their lives now you'll notice here that i'm using lifting reinforce uh prefer to use just natural rather than using lifting straps and things like that 'cause i want to build up my grip strengthened my forearms as well so very similar to hollywood would i just regular conventional deadly but you'll notice that as i do exercise i don't all the way to the bottom nor do i really fully lock it out at the top it's kind of just a mid range motion hair and pumping it so i'll do this for two sets of twenty wraps and just really focus on work in the lower back the hamstrings again this is a great system exercises works all those major muscle groups and really help to bring up your squad and your dead list

00:02:21.040 --> 00:03:05.570
now i'm going to move on to do some work for the abdominal i like train my abs using resistance exercise uh rather than just pumping high rep body weight exercises like crunches and things like that so this exercise i'm doing right here is the pool down at lunch and the great thing about it is it works the ads standing up 'cause when you're doing exercises you know i mean your abdomen to come into play and stabilize your body standing position so this is one of those rare exercises which are actually working your abs from standing position and the great thing about it is that it works the entire front midsection muscles swimming you're working you know your lower abs everything comes into play in this exercise

i'm gonna finish up to work with pull through from the local cable you can see here in the video that i'm actually adding wait wait stack because one of the problems that you are going to run into this exercise is that the typical weight stacks at most gyms are not having enough in fact i'd say that the average guy would literally gym within a couple of months of doing this exercise on a regular basis the exercise itself is a very unique movement because it will work the hamstrings groups and lower back and give you a really good stretching the bottom of the movement and provides constant attention because we're using the cables for resistance off from work this exercise back and forth with the previous exercise so i'll do is pull down out and then do i'll pull through from the local cable and it's just alternate him back and forth for more workout programs and training to be sure to check up my website is w. w. w. dot dot com and while you're there sign up for free ten part body building course in this you'll get some killer tips and tricks that will help you build lean muscle stubborn body fat and get ripped athletic physique
