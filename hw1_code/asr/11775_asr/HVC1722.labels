2.720000	302.900000	hey again with athletic nation and this a segment i'm gonna teach you how to do the olympic lift called the clean and jerk movement the first being taking the bar from the ground to the shoulder position this is the second part is the that's taken from the shoulders to arm's length overhead one solid movement now we're gonna get warmed up real quick for me i like to use just a bar or a great tool just stretch lightweight wraps get the whole body loosened up first thing i like to do with it just popped into the shoulders do about ten reps front then why my grip and ten reps show depressed from behind alright i'm going to add a little bit of weight to the bar just because for me i need a little bit more weight than just a bar itself to put my body in the correct position again we're going to start with first portion of the cleaning jerk and that's the clean now most important thing here is set up with the crowds down i like to get over the bar just keeps you but low that's one of the most important factors back straight but down you're gonna raise the bar off the ground slowly you get over the news once you get over the news is called the rebound you straighten your back bend your knees forward and then jump literally through the roof exploding with the hips the triple extension triple extension is than straightening helps raising the feet jumped position and then shrugging with the bar hips traps triple extension then as far as that position you pull up with the arms as hard as you can enforce yourself down to the bar this gives it as much momentum upward as you can possibly get pulls your body down so that you can catch the boring shoulders before it begins to lose this momentum and fall back down next thing you need to do is get a good grip on the bar is how you do that with the olympic lifting you want to take your thumb first with it and take your first and second finger and on the bar this is called hook grip we are back extra charlotte stays down up arms are locked and make sure your arm stay straight during the whole lift until you've reached that triple extension and you begin to pull the bar up to the shoulders rock back on the flat feet pull the bar and stand up just slightly began by extending the legs once you get here rock back just a little bit and then jump now motion back extend rock and jump right now that we have the bar in iraq position elbows up our shoulders forward everything's tight you get the bar overhead and as quickly motion as you possibly can you want to sit there and mess with it so anyway well we're going to do is take a jump position that's see just outside of shoulder with some maybe for others easy way to solve the jumping position to take a step without looking get ready to jump wherever your feet are that your power position jumping position ready to get the bar overhead there's two ways like i said earlier you got power jerk where you just spreads repeat out to the side of the bar and there's a split jerk you dip under the bar one foot forward one foot backwards now these are very very quick motion one split second alright i'm going to show you get to on my shoulders will start with a split jerk i put my head up much and out of the way down slowly and then up really quickly deep breath push it up through one foot forward one foot back bars locked out overhead brings feet together in line that's a good lift feet out to the sides and back in the bar still overhead for left those are the two
