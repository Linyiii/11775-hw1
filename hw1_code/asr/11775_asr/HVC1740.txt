Okay everybody or just wanted to take a moment to tell you about the textbooks that we're going to use in this course there are two of them and they're very complementary um one is called the language instinct it is and uh it has a steven thinker you could see in there with his big afro um and ah it's a great book it's really well written it's funny and gauging um has a lot of information in it but it is um it's an easy read and uh and he is a very entertaining writer um lot of a lot of a cultural references pop culture and all of his writing and um so it's it's pretty fun stuff um so we work through that book um the other book that is uh we use is called the language files and it is a collection of short to the point kinds of uh files that um address a particular topic um and they do so very succinctly so each of the just about you know five or six pages long and so you get the information that you need 'em and not a lot of extra there are a lot of um uh exercises though and so it gives you the theoretical information you need and then let's see practice right away so um that's pretty neat um the two books together make a really nice package um uh and fit together well and after working through these you know a lot about language and linguistics um so those are the books were news and um are we talking to you soon.
