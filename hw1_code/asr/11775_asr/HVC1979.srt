00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:21.050
i do a little bit better form my things to help the form of be correct on squad squad to get a bad rap because there are bad on your back and they're bad on your knees and they are if you're doing wrong if you're doing

4
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.340
it's the best exercises that you can do for a lower body squats again um universal left again

5
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.380
people do them wrong a lot so weird help you see the right way to do squats starting off

6
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.370
you to make sure the bar for most people you wanna make sure the bars right about chess level if it gets higher than that it's hard to get underneath if it's too low

7
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.560
i get an extra rep and there to get her name and get it so you want to make the the bar without chester shoulder hyped here

8
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.920
for someone to go over cigarettes this is approximately how most standard bars

9
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:05.090
two little rings little grip brings there they are approximately thirty two inches apart for most people that i had to do is take their index finger and place it on the ranks

10
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.370
yeah same here

11
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:18.120
she would take your index finger place it on the ranks so now i got a nice even grip at the start of the moving a lot of people going to need the bar they revert wrong suppose off kilter heavier

12
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.280
fried dust again promoters lower back and she's so

13
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.540
even even grip that step one step

14
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:34.870
now i'm going to step on to the bar i get a park placement on my back on the top quarter my shoulders i'm gonna show you the wrong way first and then the writer

15
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.920
um the wrong way a lot people will get up here and they'll get a high bar squat like say some piling net okay there's not a lot of

16
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:55.660
you're talking about a four inch area it's a little pinnacle on my knee on my on my next year and so and peters alot again a lot of problems on lower back a pilot but so we're gonna teach you out

17
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.650
it's too low heart places where it goes below other tracks and between the shoulder blades right here in this area so american

18
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.790
yes and all the trap get there a high morally wrong way it's a little more now the problem with the low bar squat

19
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.450
that there was like it's written your shoulder blades outlook socket

20
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.830
okay you gotta teach maybe uh individuals are like had to get their elbows up like this was watching it

21
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.020
which is here it's on a table up there it's covered

22
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
fifteen to twenty inches now as opposed to the poor insurance a pilot

23
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.700
you take your new i can't use to us

24
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.140
ability to develop this

25
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.940
but it'll be now that station number two they're got the bar placements refrained gotta get your feet right you got

26
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.570
stab each year you better darryl stance you got to why can't worry more conventional stand on the stand

27
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.410
to do if you like have our toes

28
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.710
watch out for the ducks okay you know what your feet spread out like to make sure they're

29
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.440
for most people when it first started but we try to do just go somewhere and just outside shoulders outside shoulder with those

30
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.520
straight out that i really don't see the first thing you do the first moon butter the first man

31
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.470
honest schwab is when you're not sure i mean

32
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.620
well here that's why you watch it a bad rap

33
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.200
it's my niece burning up so much tore gone up too much pressure it's bad on your knees and and also go into your back

34
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.920
going to push our hips back person like we wish they would kick the door shut that were in some kicking the door shut kick the door

35
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.770
back there now my hips for back now i'm starting to stand in the squad pushy

36
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.170
this and he's about like the flats that'd you get a shot at my feet down her go to

37
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.370
the is on the outside of my foot and on my field is not up in in on my toes case

38
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.690
my hamster back i'm exaggerating my team here it's either going to say slack and then i come back up

39
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.000
so it has something to do a few restaurants you can see that push your habits

40
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.840
don't go outside of a slow motion backup just now to about parallel and back uh

41
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.130
my knees will never drift over my toes wants money these over my toes

42
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.050
that is bad for pushes back like

43
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:20.360
out oh my gosh sitting on a horse i'm going to be like this my name is actually in a flair outlets so i'm here like this is my new nasal starts

44
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.350
but my abdominal oh down in between my name is

45
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:35.620
just like that's a kind of exaggerate when my age what we're putting out here like that

46
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:47.220
and that's a form on the squats as far as getting parallels push your hips back helping you give her though i've been standing back up when you iraq to bar mature somebody hell she spots we'll talk

47
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.800
about a second what's that uh get back into iraq at least of our earliest

48
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.880
big key where people get hurt 'cause when they pick the bar up and when they said the bar down when you pick the bar up make sure you use both feet to pick it up like a school

49
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.560
don't get in there like you're doing the lunch to try to pick it up it's all on your butt

50
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:13.960
quarter back to the same way we could back in her released it down with both legs don't lean into it um like you're going to watch the spot

51
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:27.650
we spot somebody with a guy find a guy or a male or squatting you're going to spotted underneath the chest you kind of coming up behind him help him up this way when the lady and squatting or one of the girl athletes you're going to spot what we call the w. w. b.

52
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.910
are you going to put your hand right there and kind of spot the bar if you have

53
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:42.790
on the side and never ever have one person pick up and the other one's chicken it's just bought the given you should have the heads far behind them say take it then they get all free

54
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.110
there's nothing worse to get in four or five hundred pounds on your back you get down there like there's so many grabbed one side bad on your back better

55
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.330
so it could be like on the spot or israel spiders be careful um

56
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.370
that's the basis on the spot and that's the basic on the school

57
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.550
and again this is danny at the ashworth performance you any questions you
