alright so that's a killer exercise you can do with really help spur opposite new gross totally trash or biceps like say a little little trick that i don't pollute the program but you could actually incorporate in with the program with the specialization workouts now obviously something like this is very intense it's not something that you do as part of your regular working program probably save it for when you need to bus that plateau and when you're you're i'd probably use it for like three or four weeks with your and then i i off and just go back to more traditional type training program that's less intense
