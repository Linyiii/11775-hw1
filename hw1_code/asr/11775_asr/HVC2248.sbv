hello dot com and i've got a killer exercise for you it's the decline bench triceps extension and this is one of my favorite exercises that worked for the entire trial muscle through a full range of motion i've noticed that sense of added this exercises a to my workouts i've gained a lot more size and muscle fullness to the triceps and i suppose it's actually one of my stronger poses before i start the exercise i like to use some lifting shock and chocolate my hands because this allows me to get a better and you'll notice here that i actually have the barbell propped up an exercise and this just makes it a little bit easier to reach now if you have somebody that you're training trading partner whatever you could get them to and just makes it easier to get yourself in a position to do the exercise now the main difference with using a decline bench instead of a flat bench is that you're gonna get a deeper stretch throughout the triceps and the bottom of the movement due to the angle of your upper arms you're gonna play less stress on the elbow joint and actually place more stress on the so if you normally do your line of extensions flat bench then i suggest that you give them a try on the decline bench and by doing this you're gonna work the triceps deeper range of motion and help stimulate more muscle grow so give it a try and then leave me a comic below and let me know how it works for and if you'd like to get some more great exercises to help you lean muscular physique shore to go to my website at w. w. w. dot dot com and sign up for my muscle building email course
