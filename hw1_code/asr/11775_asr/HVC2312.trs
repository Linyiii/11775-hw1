that is what you need to make a cake mix cake mixer water oil pan i sing a knife and an oven sounds complicated right you need to make a cake from scratch butter sugar salt eggs at least chewables i mix it with a paddle can measuring cups and spends parchment paper and here because for the thing you need more butter powdered sugar salt another book and and especially last measuring cups and soon and more okay so make from scratch is more complicated big deal right not just about the way they look about the taste both elements must be there so she just raising the difficulty of the process it also to taste better and defended more personalized artistic way so patient is really that important let me tell you a little bit about the presentation of food because it directly affects the satisfaction that people get some food people rely on the looks of their food to tell them how will taste and if the icing his green or the decorating the cable hardly be appetizing even manufacturers have sometimes if companies find the perfect color die packaged food they can unless slavery and tasty cake still taste as much like cake as any normal one one of course i'm a pastry chef whenever execute horribly deceiving so don't worry but women are beautifully flavored but he must surely they starting to realize what the big deal with this they are awesome they're not always easy to make i think because that's kind of kick isn't the kind that comes from a mix brownies escaped because is pretty good my senior project because i wanted to find out how difficult it is i've always been interested in the world of cooking and baking the first time i ever thought about really learning to make cakes when when i was about twelve or thirteen i if i could make my dad's birthday cake chocolate of course because what doesn't like chocolate i remember having mixing process went but one step into the baking does stick out in my memory i was really nervous about letting the cake for too long because i knew that dry incredibly case just weren't that great i kept opening the oven and my mom kept saying you have an out finally i just decided to take it out even though it could've been done it was iced the candles and we dug in not tobacco or anything but it was the most most delicious chocolate cake any every with the chocolate tasting melting in my mouth i wondered 'cause i did some day if i can make a cake like right now what could i do a couple of years of calling school i'd been in the next cake boss so i guess i wasn't really thinking those backwards cake boss wasn't even around then i was i didn't realize that i was interested in learning to kick that day so end of my junior year i knew that i wanted to take senior project and i'm sure i wanted to learn about cakes i thought that if i could have a taste of cake baking is like i would have a clear picture whether i wanna go into the profession later in life at the beginning of my projects there a couple of things i was expecting to have happen one i wanted to visit at least three bakeries behind the scenes to get a feel for what professional like to i wanted to have lots of practice making cakes with my own with my mentor and on my own and three i really did not want to give up any of my other activities the problem was number one number two strictly conflicted with number three i think the second term of school i had to make the decision of whether or not to continue doing dance team in the spring in order to have more free time to visit degrees and work on baking cakes i eventually decided to give up dance team according to call i made it seemed like it'd be visiting a lot of bakeries and i would need the extra free time i was only able to visit one degree i talk to more than for others about visiting them but none of them worked out it was disappointing for me to give up a part of my projects that i thought was important given a dance team one of my favorite activities to make more free time for it however they experience i had the one i did visit was extremely positive all the baker's that worked there were very willing to answer any questions i had and i got to watch 'em very experienced pastry chef eyes to cakes and talk to him about the professional world of picking the most enjoyable during the course of my project we're baking a cake with my mentor and on my own it was very fortunate you know that helped me assignment or she already taken senior project her senior year and then her senior project on baking cakes as well it was a perfect fit because she had gone to call in our school so she knew about baking cakes as well as about taking senior project cakes altogether successes which were not the cake i made it started my project was an experiment you could say i decided it would be useful to try weighing the ingredients on the scale instead of using measuring cups and students because that's the way professionals measure ingredients i use a recipe that needed to cut down to a smaller amounts and somewhere between the eggs and milk i'm messed up the division vacation arrived at all and when i took it out of the one of the list for precisely and half it was discouraging to realize that learning to bake cakes wasn't going to be so easy but i was really excited to have another child at some other child included cake with butter cream icing that was just for fun it was enjoying my son's i also made with whipped cream icing for surprise birthday party of these cakes were made to round cape cut in half to make four layers filled with butter cream icing on the cake i made was for my extended family is easter dinner and it was a delicious lemon pancake filled with lemon butter cream icing was two tiered each consisting of four layers of cake and filled with butter cream icing carolyn i worked for many difficulties with about her and i sing but in the end it turned out very well for my senior project i decided to make cupcakes to salad royce feel good stand afternoon church life here's that process

i learned some carolyn throughout the project such as how sniffly ice the size of by making first how how close one last week on top of another one was a huge help during that process and with all of the cakes i made other tools as well as buying most of the ingredients i needed i really could not have done this project without all the time and money she spent helping me for that i'm extremely grateful experienced in senior project has completely worthwhile i have enjoyed every moment above the class and my project and i've learned so much about baking cakes and about myself through the process currently i'm planning on going to in school within the next few years so that i can learn even more about baking and perhaps become a professional for my project i learn just how much i love to create that are the cakes are and i look forward to practice and learning more thank you
