hi this is uh more i just kinda long ago with my uh i'm right here campaigning tiny grows and mississippi or we just got here yesterday at this thing up and watch it last night uh today i just kind of want to give a lower kinda introduction to show it off just a little bit so first off all start with outside the um i do have the just kinda let you know i'm just up here at the top as all all the fly here but first thing i was on the ground i went ahead and take that all six four corners points uh once i got those down there there's actually three polls that you use 'em can't really say around here but um they are actually the ones on my hands are cold i've got a little edge it comes out there and then they kinda go through there and actually meet in the middle and started inside a force each corner come down that each corner um goes together i go down to after you do that all the little clips the paint uses a cliff so a clip all those go ahead and get pretty much standard at that point then you take this other call here it's just a straight calls a this little sleeve here goes out the other side and then uh into the little they're in the same thing those are up they clipped clipped so that's pretty much outside um after that you had the last uh the at each and using the seats available here they're really just kinda goes around the corner and that kind of and and then and there's actually a little kind of go underneath the little down and then use these little towns and you actually teaching the fly with at once you get 'em all done and there's of course there's one for each day other six of them that you do this why also one thing about it is a color coded go with the blanks giants orange crap still with and it's good to know because actually yesterday when i first started up outside of the but the thing is is a here it's not as weatherproof is the other side the other side you can actually see there it's got that orange a fabric all the right around the door and that just helps keep some of the water doesn't have it and that's because that has the vegetable vegetable comes with a fly which comes with the you can buy an optional vegetable depend on the other side of the basketball players a little bit larger than i did not get it um this festival steaks and and the bottom here to stay out there and of course ages i roll up when need to use it you just and uh actually the first somewhere up here uh you for it so close um and then there's a slave that comes over that one for me to say that the neat thing about the size you can kind of roll it up that way you can have the the tent that way uh uh you just had to just a few extra things but um i think that's pretty neat that you can go ahead and patriot act this and we just have a right now we've kinda got thrown over there they're why we have this very last night we looked at the stars and looked at it like like out here we have a that we can kind of get a little ventilation and then also what just got rolled up kinda hard to tell because of the thing is uh thrown over but it's where all the all gotta do is um just little things here and the down and won't take but i don't know 2-3 managing probably i'd probably get all this done in about two minutes to just come out here and pull it all day on the way it is um one thing i noticed i just notice just a while ago actually to notice it but the team actually pulled to the left and that's because of the vegetables now i'm not sure if i got the other imported over there kind even that out um i guess i could live up a little slap on the vegetable and it would probably back straight but i'm not sure i'll probably play with a little bit lighter i did notice that the team's not real real sturdy or just a corner steak now of course the climate to me that's the guidelines and everything so you can take it down if uh if you're gonna have bad weather or anything like that um but it is kind of it's dirty enough to to use the ban but if it was going to be bad weather you definitely want to take that thing out of the guidelines um basically attached to each side where the polls are there some tabs on the line that you can attach it to a last night i don't think i'm gonna do it because of the way they're supposed to be clear maybe some thunderstorms tomorrow we're leaving tomorrow so um as far as the inside of the tent and you can access it from either side got these um bans if all the way around

00:06:40.240000,00:08:51.170000
there's one over there to all the way around and then they stop at the top there are and then what's neat and show you need is talking on the inside of the doors and by around if you want to have them out of your way you can just up in those pockets i thought that was kinda neat um there's lots of towns that are throughout the tent hang plenty of stuff on the ceiling fans or whatever you need to hang um there's a pocket base here in each corner there's the big one uh right next door there's one there and then there's one on the other walls there and then there's also a smaller one down in the corner of and like each corners that another thing too um there's a wall to wall um there's a little toggle down there that connects the bottom of 'em that way you can unconnected and you can go ahead and you can actually up and paint you to sign that way you can move around in there and you can do both sides uh just chose not to because the pockets on this one to use the up there for pockets on this side for pockets a right opposite of that on the other side so you can access those um thing holds for uh there's plenty of room for for but i wouldn't little people are small kids no problem in this thing but just for normal size adult that's about all you get in here also to the doors um they can roll down and you can roll 'em up and attachment to the bottom why they're hanging out of the way there is reflective a gallon which makes it nice at night so you can spot i'm really easy um

00:08:51.170000,00:09:55.640000
other than that gave me an idea as the ring did you have in their for two people laying down south side they match in here that's a regular five man i always push all the foot and there's probably about a foot or a little extra more had room at the top so you've got plenty of room to stretch out and not really hitting the um anyway this is the uh for them for a one of the thing is not as close to waterproof so if you don't buy vegetables um you can say that orange on the inside that kinda helps keep the water out and then also this little owning um it's kind of like a little bit of water i don't know i haven't passed it yet so i guess in time but anyway

00:09:55.750000,00:10:03.090000
let's see uh
