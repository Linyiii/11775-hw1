1
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:55.950
okay never gonna show it is just a little bit definition cakes or do you feel windows maybe just to keep with more stress i swear for for that but it's based on the last to get into shape however

2
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:06.340
just for that much interest not too much

3
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:30.180
and then she gets stuck with us

4
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.770
again with the larger one

5
00:01:35.770 --> 00:02:11.820
i can use that somebody's or to really do anything with the water just make sure it's not too much since really soft and sticky

6
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:27.210
mean if you wanted to you could always use just for this like a late says sweets like

7
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:39.450
to them that well titles on the roof or did you see the back of life and i'm just gonna run the nice along

8
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.630
just to i said

9
00:02:46.630 --> 00:03:20.090
you can do this for the run if you like and you can just pay the the we can also get pirated i'm not i'm just going to

10
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:36.300
if you wanted to maybe like i was on

11
00:03:36.300 --> 00:04:08.560
okay that we can do next country type she wanted to play the games just the taste last civil

12
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:32.140
just to hold it against say

13
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:59.070
and then for the baby is just a small

14
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:21.660
friend that was somebody from the school system which is really fun

15
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:40.100
they

16
00:05:40.100 --> 00:06:31.790
he wanted to decided that you have to question has made and a glass of experiences well you could do that makes i would you started actually the the team actually when i met somebody go to

17
00:06:31.790 --> 00:07:13.580
personally i don't know not you want you to do that with a nice so this is the yeah it was just pour it into a trade like with the so you can say so now the only problem i have to say just when you present it can be quite well we're supposed to just be most of my children to use which is nice

18
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:35.790
i'm just you can say

19
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.990
put aside but

20
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:49.260
uh uh

21
00:07:49.260 --> 00:08:10.420
you just wanted to get to play you know

22
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:51.710
they can also use i'm i'm totally onto it or just so convenient but it's just not really tickets with windows just basically do what they say you can just kind of details that wanted

23
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.320
a big or small windows and they always wanted to swindle free

24
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:17.960
just a

25
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:26.210
we can just start to just go straight to a lake and just straight up too

26
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:47.590
and he loves strips of windows or something else for the money roll which is a a lot harder than the i think they can make shapes leave them out to dry

27
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:58.110
expensive it's quite dr

28
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.090
uh

29
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:21.670
what you do it's almost like clean credit it to the side and chase him on the prejudice can justify that with

30
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:29.610
but you want to distribute windows just to kind of shape

31
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:41.130
a little bit

32
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.120
kind of go together but

33
00:10:44.120 --> 00:11:01.230
uh

34
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:22.390
that is quite good thing to do if you want to get today

35
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:50.220
they say windows maybe just to try overnight can she can she also they're not chocolate sometimes sometimes i just to get a nice with a little bit of other than his wife

36
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:58.010
and uh

37
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:08.890
and then later on you could always just kind of windows and some kind of just taking more definition

38
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:17.060
to cut using an average

39
00:12:17.060 --> 00:13:03.270
and the forties that just the but you know who won but i'm going to mix it with the reason i mix it with it's sort of alcoholic operate i will do that really um just from the not too bad just to get um just just met

40
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:13.110
didn't have to remember the

41
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:38.720
he's not on the

42
00:13:38.720 --> 00:14:02.950
uh

43
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:12.820
to uh

44
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:33.260
that is a a lot since

45
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:39.100
just had a slight technical age we we're got

46
00:14:39.100 --> 00:15:07.130
right okay i'm just quit showing spray now they want to hear if i just windows and then depends on top swiping emotion just very

47
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:36.890
about twenty minutes and just keeping the car off again come up with with open for the most with a nice as well

48
00:15:36.890 --> 00:16:12.230
that would be to just give it some some techniques if i was going or if you have to start again you could use on hold for just

49
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:44.040
it's gonna get three men on the news uh and again just because i didn't see it so frightening

50
00:16:44.040 --> 00:17:47.290
well i don't tend to put too much on it and trying to find ten minutes ten minutes all kinds of places uh again a kind of climate detail you use it

51
00:17:47.290 --> 00:18:12.240
yeah we're just having just sort of because got to pick them up right now and then i test scores cases right now technician technical to give you an idea like i said before

52
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:25.850
to pick i

53
00:18:25.850 --> 00:19:13.290
you can see that would be quite put too much stuff to dress as i can see the german people do that just i mean i would try and he's making a window like since i have to it can get

54
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:41.350
wonderful things about instructional videos and three different painting retailing hopefully you know all that you need to know if there's anything else you can talk on the paper and you can you help your health and well we yesterday it was very helpful and i'm really looking forward to seeing everyone has the

55
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:51.010
yeah definitely going to your credit in the building i don't think any any one particular older

56
00:19:51.010 --> 00:20:03.460
