Hello i'm in the process of video clip of bench press work that i did the other day like i mentioned in my last video posted in the process of doing a power lifting stuff training program so what i'm doing now where the next few months i want to get my my strength back up again and then later in the spring or early summer around that time i'm gonna switch gears dining down for a body building competition so further do take it out i'll show you the bench press workout.
First exercises workout at the these are done for eight seventy three rats and done an explosive fashion to only use about fifty percent of your but again really focus on being powerful and fast way rather than the slower control type of forms that most body building from power lifting work the dynamic day folks speed and.
One thing i'm sure you've noticed the set up that they use now this isn't your typical bench press set up that see most people do in the gym so what i've done that you can get a better view of how i set up for the the first thing i do is i play some feedback from behind me so that i can get good like drive without my lifting off the bench now the main thing here to pull your shoulder blades back together behind you plant them firmly into the bench pad while expanding your chest and rib cage this place you stronger position a bench and the last minute my shoulder rotation and just reduce your risk of shoulder injury now i know a lot of people that are totally against our junior back but the fact is your back is actually in strongest disposition when it's arch and the muscles are contracted.
Now i'm going to move on and do some work for the this exercise here the rolling dumbbell extension and it's kinda like a combination of a dumbbell bench press and as you can see here on lowering the dumbbells down and come down i let them towards my head and this really stretches the triceps good and it allows you to handle a bit more weight than you could if you were doing a strict line this is great exercise for building up the triceps really help blackout now i'm going to move on and do some shoulder work here in the video clip i'm doing side lateral raises and this is important to do because you want to keep your shoulders in proportion when you're doing a lot of what happens is your takes a lot of the stress we don't get much work on the side and the so supplemental exercising your workout balance that out so now here i'm moving on to the reverse dumbbell flies and this is a great exercise for the the upper back and again it's like say you want to build up your upper back because it'll keep things in proportion and it also give you a bigger base that you can actually later you know when you're playing your upper back into the bench and help you get more drive when you start your bench press.
