1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.660
do you do

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.180
taking over

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:01:42.130
that is going to make it right now i just finished eating it last night um we're making a ginger macadamia pineapple carrot cake so i'm in uniform new jersey right now still and hometown have all the of my parents kitchen so i have a little more space and i'm an electric mixture so that would be good for today so flowers here and it's pretty we have our spaces um we're adding to teach me the cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg and salt and here are baking soda and making so that's just and you can fit this or just i don't really things that often but um if you want to be extra so that is all mixed up i have sugar in here three quarters cup and we're gonna be adding with their uh so i'm and i think we need a full of this kind apple juice

4
00:01:42.130 --> 00:02:02.960
cape may sound like a weird combination very much and um we need a whole of maple syrup that goes in okay and then we also need um two teaspoons of extract monsters bottle

5
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.780
yeah exactly so to me that and

6
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:30.730
and now you can just make sure that the sugar on mixed in with all of that and then you can and the dry mixture you just made into the mixture and i think you're supposed to mix it in fashion so little and this

7
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:46.380
makes that i'll just keep doing that and the second person the other person for a i i have um

8
00:02:46.380 --> 00:03:14.200
and and who's not pleased with me for not inviting or yet on the show she will be watching but she'll be soon so stay tuned for that she makes really really good okay so this is the basic bad that we have to put more complicated step ahead of the other things are going that to go in it

9
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:54.930
first thing we are going to do now is um you can put as much as you want i think this is gonna be about a half a cup so just make sure they're just saying that they're going to be in the cape so what you know how big of a and the christmas injure is i'm kinda hot but it's really really good it's like conan sugar here that's what it looks like you can buy it um i don't know probably everywhere but maybe try something like a little more upscale and find out if you can't for the ginger

10
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:10.950
ah yeah chop it up into pretty small pieces again you know you're like when i eat at the last and you can really it's a pretty strong so i would suggest very small pieces

11
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:28.610
uh the average guy that live there

12
00:04:28.610 --> 00:05:06.250
gender done and we put this here wondering why i keep looking over that way because my mom putting over watching me think of it she had a lovely thanksgiving this year and all i guess just left and she and my dad all these ingredients they contribute to this cake um okay so carrots um we're i think

13
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:29.790
something on average i hadn't

14
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:50.860
oh my god i just got mine no i'm oh sorry i just filled up a piece of mail college i'm feeling now we're gonna shops were left with some weird carrot pizzas though that to to kill

15
00:05:50.860 --> 00:06:02.720

16
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:24.120
