okay i don't want anyone to hear me say this so professional sports right trying to cut the cord on that one i think that they have outlived their restaurant and apparently on monday or some kind of like big football game on t._v. and show called quarterback has any kind of is how are we going to bail out the entire world financial system we don't have the money to do it or how are people who you're going to sports growing up and playing games really a whole section in the paper and people can at least an hour followed him you know the characters and they know or whatever that kind of energy and learning about what was going on in the world do you think that maybe the government wants to pay attention you know the very thing it's entirely possible more to the point is really popular girls who pretended like they wanna watch the game and they care about sports
