63.930000	70.510000	it's not my not my fault not intentionally a lotta people seem to take it that way you know it's a quick fix
70.510000	151.910000	it fixes itself you know i can't quite begin to tell you all the crazy stories that have happened in the car just this thing ultimately attract the craziest adventures i've ever been on for instance somebody to work one morning and in between the car and another car there's a goose probably running like twenty miles per hour with traffic running from the car behind it it must have lost control because it whereabouts in milan and yeah i couldn't really over a goose it was like hitting pile bricks really like i said i don't know how you hear the the first place how you hit people run over squirrels raccoons whatnot all the time they i mean you never see a goose run its way in front of a car the worst thing that's ever happened in the car was when i lost brake fluid pressure just like totally lost all my brakes going through maybe three stop signs and a couple of flights i went through all these lights and things are going in reverse granted some years and i stopped it still the pressure but i've got this handy dandy brake fluid which gets me through the hard times i don't know what it is about this but a lotta people tend to laugh at it and also find it offensive towards that maybe i don't i don't know they pretty much they'll hit my car or whatnot just anybody that's pretty much
