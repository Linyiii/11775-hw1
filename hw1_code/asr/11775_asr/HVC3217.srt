how you doing today i mean i've got some real quick what was the best way to tell like a girl that you're really not interested without hurting feeling no time for friends for no good question i decided yeah yeah and then then i think that maybe you know i think it's funny sometimes how the differences between men and women so like crazy like do you think do you think men understand women in your opinion now well maybe not fully but i don't think we've kind of down i think they give you an honest opinion on this because i'm really smart and everything has helped me understand with it a little bit but i think everyone should have two parts on one side you have like the socially programs all the rules and regulations notice either needles stereotypes would over there with my friends think if they saw me with this guy my family over there and then you have this other side of a woman which called the natural side all of a fantasy criticize i want to tell you anything like that

2
00:01:47.790 --> 00:02:00.770
i definitely have that like uh i think both have like what culture tells you when you're not then there's also the you really wanna do

3
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:23.230
yeah that's true because like the natural natural with like you weren't treated like a lot of english books we read in class taking a psychology class so what kind of interesting thing they've won so far about

00:02:23.230 --> 00:04:13.310
um actually i'm i was doing a study of different ways that men and women advertisements so we did like match dot com so that's a lot of talking about parental investments the differences that men give to women and men to have an actual relationship and it was also evolutionary standpoint psychology and um just meeting in general and um continuing your generation and it was interesting because in the past like men have always been i'm looking for a the males and females have been speaking resource kind of material from men and resources being some time and and obviously changed from evolutionary standpoint because it goes from it could be in any other country how many at like and that's like their their status as well what they have to offer and but now more more money and like how much your salary is what you make and then you have an education and so that men on looking for women really long attractive so women and losing fertility so that's the men to continue their generation when when the so what we found was that like from back then like in the seventies when they first started doing the study that was the transit men for track with males females for resources but i'm more recently and like two doesn't work on it was found that men responding more ads where women describe yourself as financially independent and successful than the attractive

00:04:13.310 --> 00:06:19.910
really i in a while i was saying that for women visually and i was a girl was it would be turned on like that with a woman to feel safe with this person got that call talking about right or whatever you feel comfortable with this person's 'cause like one that's taking place like everything else when you're with this person everything else disappear and feel like you might find yourself hanging on everything this person now with me i find that one that's like that to happen and that's really cool experience to know each other and stuff over here in minnesota interesting you can go anywhere in the world without want to hire more money what would you go everywhere i've been to some parts of the mediterranean see like the mediterranean area was really cool 'cause like when someone new it's amazing 'cause you can like the culture is totally different from like american people act down here it's like everybody is so friendly like walk up someone talking like an american you know uh you guys are like in a rush shopping and everything i got my cooking

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:33.960
