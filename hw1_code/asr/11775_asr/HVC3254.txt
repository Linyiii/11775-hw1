Heavier and heavier heavier clothes are getting wet your packs getting wet your clothes start get heavier do not go until the point of exhaustion stop build yourself shelter i can't say that every time it's like you're only got a hundred feet don't stop so this is what i what i would do if i'm two or three miles from detroit head and it's just deadly get heavier in heaven heavier i know they're gonna be passing over but i don't know how long i'm gonna stop and build a shelter so still shelter between industry.
First thing i want to point out before somebody else does is at the end of the not long rope.
You wanna burn the end of it but this was i wanted to get shelter set up quick to not take the time to barney and i'll cut a little bit off of her around and then uh fernando doesn't break whenever you're using a u._s. army poncho or any poncho shelter you want to take the hood twisted up and just kinda knotted up into a ball or else you don't want to live on you i've got the try to go out like a forty five degree angle listen here's not forty five degrees now this is just a part-time shelter let's say you're only going to stop in here for a little bit because it's pouring down rain you just need the rain for a little while you want to get you get the minute back in your body is kind of shelter i was going to that you would put up if you were going to spend the night if you were going to spend the night you would drop them all the way down to the ground and take these tents that we would want to put them since that that whole and take control punch up against this edge all along here put it up there with that does is it keeps it moist not air from coming in from your side intellectual keeps keeps across from coming at you then you can like branches and stuff on his back and see what all help keep some of that not.
I run the cord between two trees tied slip knot and everything so it's easy to take down slip knot for well like slip knot they're either put up there to take down we get whenever you want to pick your camp up in a hurry kind of hard to slip knot alright guys so there we go got enough room underneath there gets kinda just squatting down here this is what it looks like on the inside and here's my pack carrying around all day and it's not good to leave your why keep poncho right down the south side pocket second it in a hurry our parents and stuff out in the field a beer and some other stuff so that's what i've got four so you a competition g._p._s. but this was in this is what inside shelter looks like you had a cheap poncho this is why you want to carry with you whenever you feel you can use one poncho for your main shelter and then use the cheaper like a two dollar you see those uh stores where they're really cheap using a couple of times a couple of those one of them at least one of them inside your pack their life they don't take up a lot of room and if you're sitting on the ground you just use it as a ground fault throw it down keep you off the ground.
