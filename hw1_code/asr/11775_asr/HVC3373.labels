4.410000	101.050000	welcome to now i think you see some flowers around all the time now so i thought today would take a different look at so when you buy some flowers usually just stick them in some tall container because there are so long you can't really say they're pretty faces can when they're down a little bit lower so today i'm going to take their styles which are a problem and turn them into our solution for this arrangement i've chosen very low container now it's gonna present some problems but i think we can solve them pretty easily when i'm going to do is i'm going to put the stems in low but you can say they're so heavy that will stop right out of the container i'm gonna take a couple of sunflower stems and tie them together to make a lot of to support the heads in the face so before we begin or laugh it occurred to me that the study looks pretty in the face so i'm going to take some grapevine and i'm gonna wrap my face and the prior to doing anything else so i purchased a scrape by material from a local craft shop and i'm just going to begin by wrapping it i have a lazy susan under my base so it makes it a little easier for me to turn it any natural material work for you so i've got two stems from some flowers and i've come to about the right that i want them you can always turn them down there too long later i like to use a product called which is a paper but you could use ordinary garden twist ties any kind of a thing that will just twist die so there's not really that complicated i want to take my
101.050000	150.270000	around my and i'm gonna make a twist to hold it in place it across i'm to go under come back up through the middle basically i'm a little bit over that wire i can come back up and hold it in place on that side and go back over to the side come under and do the same thing over the top rapid down through come back up so it's gonna stay in place
150.270000	165.480000	and then just turn it off so we've taken these troublesome little stands and turn them into our solution together and now we have a place for our little flower has to stay up right so we place this little lettuce right on top of the base
165.480000	196.020000	don't have anything else we can start adding some flowers just pushing them down through the loudest i'm also going to add some greenery um these are from the garden but any kind of green leaves for work we're just gonna add those right in with them you're gonna need six or seven some flowers maybe
196.020000	215.570000	this is a new look at having sunflowers center piece you've taken the problem which was too long for them and you turn them into your solution by making a lot of hold up there pretty heads and you can see over there i think that's really lovely there are quite pretty like seeing them up close and personal joining us remember when it comes to flowers
