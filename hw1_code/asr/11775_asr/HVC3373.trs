welcome to now i think you see some flowers around all the time now so i thought today would take a different look at so when you buy some flowers usually just stick them in some tall container because there are so long you can't really say they're pretty faces can when they're down a little bit lower so today i'm going to take their styles which are a problem and turn them into our solution for this arrangement i've chosen very low container now it's gonna present some problems but i think we can solve them pretty easily when i'm going to do is i'm going to put the stems in low but you can say they're so heavy that will stop right out of the container i'm gonna take a couple of sunflower stems and tie them together to make a lot of to support the heads in the face so before we begin or laugh it occurred to me that the study looks pretty in the face so i'm going to take some grapevine and i'm gonna wrap my face and the prior to doing anything else so i purchased a scrape by material from a local craft shop and i'm just going to begin by wrapping it i have a lazy susan under my base so it makes it a little easier for me to turn it any natural material work for you so i've got two stems from some flowers and i've come to about the right that i want them you can always turn them down there too long later i like to use a product called which is a paper but you could use ordinary garden twist ties any kind of a thing that will just twist die so there's not really that complicated i want to take my

around my and i'm gonna make a twist to hold it in place it across i'm to go under come back up through the middle basically i'm a little bit over that wire i can come back up and hold it in place on that side and go back over to the side come under and do the same thing over the top rapid down through come back up so it's gonna stay in place
