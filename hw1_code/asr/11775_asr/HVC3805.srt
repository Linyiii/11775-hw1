that has forever altered the lie to breed men who at one time were happy to call union college they're home unfortunately they can't do that anymore they can't do that because the threat with me on their lives why because they were they were because they believe what they believe that this was a crime more so it was a hate crime i understand that some people out there that homosexuality is wrong that's your opinion while i many others not agree with you you have the right to your opinion but you not have the right to do is to attack a person verbally or physically because they didn't share the same opinion of you because they live a lifestyle that you do not agree
