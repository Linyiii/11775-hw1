video we're going to be doing a thirty six eighty now pretty certain power jack is bad because we smelled it and it's burning coming from the the so it's probably pretty frightening there but what i always like to do anyways checked the power adaptor make sure that is okay because if that's not okay then um that might be a quick fix right there i take the black lead on my i put on the outside of the tip of the power doctor and she always took a paper clip into the the tip their with the red positive on the tip touches the paper clip i only use when i can actually fit the red lead into the tip of the power adaptor and we're we're getting nineteen bulge there so we know the power now you don't need to use the paper clip if the actual tip of positive fits into the hole and also remember you don't want to touch the black and the red together when you're hook up the power like that because are going to get a short circuits are okay through the phone down there so i don't scratched the surface of the computer and i flip the computer over and we're just going to start taking component out of the computer now because we've got to get to the power jack which is really attached to the mother board
