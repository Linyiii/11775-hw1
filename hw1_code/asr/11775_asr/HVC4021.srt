1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.760
oh they're just gonna thing it plan get out of my head i don't remember

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.880
so no memory and i don't remember i thing so when i'm feeling really down about my really in the

3
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.180
and and myself things kind of low to turn on the t._v. and watch my super sweet sixteen

4
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.960
okay at least i'm not like that

5
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:42.230
so i bring out the costs camping in mexico which isn't imperative in when jokes and you really interesting because here put in like a sect of people who like used

6
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.610
anything about them and you're trying to get out as much information as possible and since i'm at a practical basically we're all from out of state from like all over the country and

7
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.450
and the easiest thing

8
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.210
to learn english people should like associate characters with them about their state

9
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.880
i'm from colorado and then like oh you can allied mountains then no the release of the caribbean or drifts

10
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.810
no let me think texas either tense

11
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.740
i'm from colorado and i need judgements about people from california and all over the east and everything

12
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.330
so the one thing i've learned at my school we have all kinds of museums i don't know just

13
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.480
lots of liberal arts and all the kids are pretty smart and whenever i go to a party i've learned that psychology majors are really good at peer pressure

14
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.630
and they they know their stuff

15
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.340
to take a drink no non get no like it it tastes great not good

16
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:50.680
so that hold your life when you went know collateral father figure and western attendant holding your line no uh

17
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.350
and again oh so i got to experience the election on a liberal

18
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.880
campus wasn't between

19
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:09.410
buying a cane it was between osama and neater there was no mccain on my campus did you register did you registered have you brush or did you vote did you go did you both

20
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.160
were doing this

21
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.010
maybe dreamed politically apathetic ten minutes and like i'm sorry

22
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.380
okay so i i'm a little bit too liberal on some things were not

23
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.420
to get into that because i really like my face the shape it is

24
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
get punched in way on here but i

25
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:44.190
opinion down at an art school and it had got me into a lot of debates and i've learned a whole bunch of like political labels that i've never heard before like and our go send the

26
00:02:44.190 --> 00:03:00.610
little community sense ram a butcher in a bigger and risk it'd be like an r. t. but we're going to be organized and then i get really can i'm like i like

27
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:25.010
and i got paid they really got me i started thinking like what would it be like to live in a libertarian household like to grow up in one and the little baby like had walked me he can what where are crime you want to be said again you and your self self reliant dairy queens

28
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.260
so sometimes when i'm on yahoo

29
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.960
and i read my spanish it makes me feel really bad

30
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.220
so i'm like no i don't need to use car or to make money on craig's list or want to lose eighty five pounds of grown a date with the lana
