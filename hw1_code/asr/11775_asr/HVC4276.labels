6.540000	30.140000	video we're going to have power laptop and what's wrong with this computer chip on the inside of the power jack is loose somewhat open it up and see if i see anything on the jack itself or inside the show what's happening in there and get it fixed up
30.140000	40.700000	first thing i'd like to do is get a piece of phone so i turn the computer over it doesn't scratch surface of the computer
40.700000	55.830000	and then first and second thing actually take the battery off and then i like to start taking components out of the machine because i know i'm going to get down to mother board level so to take the memory out hard drive
55.830000	71.220000	anything that's attached to the mother board that's gonna stop me from getting getting the whole computer apart
71.220000	75.420000	take a hard drive out here
75.420000	98.030000	there's computers very dusty on the inside so usually out of a laptop for i um you know give it back to a customer but if i'm gonna take the entire laptop apart i won't clean anything i'll clean it on uh as i go basis so
98.030000	108.550000	most machines secrets i'd like to do is to get that front tops laid off this allows me to get access to keyboard and screen which are two things i like take off next
