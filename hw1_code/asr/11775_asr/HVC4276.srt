video we're going to have power laptop and what's wrong with this computer chip on the inside of the power jack is loose somewhat open it up and see if i see anything on the jack itself or inside the show what's happening in there and get it fixed up

2
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:40.700
first thing i'd like to do is get a piece of phone so i turn the computer over it doesn't scratch surface of the computer

3
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:55.830
and then first and second thing actually take the battery off and then i like to start taking components out of the machine because i know i'm going to get down to mother board level so to take the memory out hard drive

4
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:11.220
anything that's attached to the mother board that's gonna stop me from getting getting the whole computer apart

5
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
take a hard drive out here

6
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:38.030
there's computers very dusty on the inside so usually out of a laptop for i um you know give it back to a customer but if i'm gonna take the entire laptop apart i won't clean anything i'll clean it on uh as i go basis so

7
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.550
most machines secrets i'd like to do is to get that front tops laid off this allows me to get access to keyboard and screen which are two things i like take off next
