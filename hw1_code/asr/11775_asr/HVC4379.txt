So i wasn't trying they're scary scary i'm seriously hurt it doesn't matter here's the deal here's the deal i'm hurting bad and i need to go to a doctor you're probably to yourself so i just got on the phone with my dad and i ended up telling him about the whole bomb scares school but um funny thing is i made it seem like it was a joke they broke my leg thing is he still have a job and don't give up my apartment because i can't afford to pay the rent so when i was thinking oh maybe getting me no no no um i was thinking that maybe i would live here at the time being um what we can do considering them for you i'd be employed ruins again kind of three online versus versus a room to do is dr the.
You have to tell the doctor that you did this to me no not for you okay how about you tell him i fell out of my dad's monster truck when we were jumping over the house.
