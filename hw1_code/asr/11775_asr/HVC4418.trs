penalty shot before you take a penalty shot practice at least two different methods for taking a penalty shut your moves they'll get too predictable when facing the opposing goalie frederick will show you penalty shot with for building variations enabling you change your shot direction at the last second if the goalie is camping out on the side you are planning to shoot the ball then the penalty giving you another penalties shot with for building variations remember do not run at full speed when approaching the goalie during a penalty shut you may lose control of the ball completely or not have enough control the ball to execute desired shot frederick either start way out to the left for the ride variation number four and the other three penalty shots however in this case the first to the other side should be much shorter and then followed with two longer stick handling moves to get the goalie out of balance
