so you have any new commander in chief what do you think about that i'm so happy and so hopeful so so so many things right now um i can't even i don't know i think it's still showing off so shock i'm really really excited okay what is your what is your favorite part of his speech uh easily thing down to tear apart and um or something the effect of um as far as common defense rejected falls the choice between our safety and our ideal something which is so important in this day you know we have this whole war on terrorism we have you know our national defence and our safety which we're so concerned with but it seems that over the last decade most of the last decade we've completely forgot someone said give me liberty or give me death and that's the ideal abide by um i think it's really it's a great thing to see someone stand up and say yes we're american yes we have ideals and no we won't we won't sacrifice our ideals for some false sense of security there's a there's a place for security and this is not there's not a political statement by any stretch but i think as americans to realize that we're we're country of ideals and if we sacrifice sacrifices ideals and we really have nothing so it's it's refreshing it's exciting to see this man stand up for what we believe in the nation and not sacrificed our own national morals
