alright and spend fifteen minutes since our uh has been doing here so it's gonna take twenty minutes to get the uh the potatoes then at fifteen minutes or so for the back there so i've got to make the uh potatoes on the twenty minutes cooked tender that we can smash those needs to take fifteen minutes so um we actually turn those on five minutes after so the dog down the same time anyhow will be back and you can see we're still blown away here the i guess is a pretty good clip about um ten minutes or so and the potatoes and then will be done needs needs you want to say i'm about five minutes to get those finished up around that time the hassle we don't play up in a back alright here we are we're i'm done cooking guess we're just looking pretty good really good some mashed potatoes actually made chicken stock
