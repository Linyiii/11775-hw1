i'd probably get more work done in the studio in the summertime in the spring if i was uh down here but i think it's good for my mind to be able to be down here um so i would say that i get away with it without having it like interfere it's funny i guess like there's a lot of things that are similar i'm a maker and so um it's a lot about process like that's what makes him making different than a lot of other it's not direct you have to go through all these things and then you put something in the press and then you lift it up and there's this thing and it's just magical moment and i think that in that now it's really similar to gardening because you do all this work with the soil and building the fence and you know put the in the ground and then magically like turns into this thing that you can eat
