you got your knitting and your your your threat is here and you're gonna start picking up along the side to stick the needle in that side to first ditch and then you take the needle stick to to make like a net and put it around and there is your first pitch on that needle they take your needle to pick up your second thread which is very hard to see you in for me this late and you put the first needle through and unit you pull it over so in my case i have to pick up fourteen stiches down this side i'll do the third one just to show you like i said i like to pick up too so that there's no sort of effect and it gets quite tight enough picked up three fourteen along the side and then you go across the stitches that you have one and then you're going to pick up again and then you have a circle and you're gonna start going in circles so hopefully that makes sense to you okay so you're going in it this way down the side seems really awkward but after you've done a couple of times you get the get the gist of it so that helps
