Hello and today i want to talk about conversation everyday talk and of course i'm to talk about it in uh.
Business professional environment not an everyday social conversation uh in in assumes that this conversation that we're talking about um takes place in business and professional contacts but also probably between equals in the work environment or with a superior and i think it's not a bad idea to have the same standard for both of your directing the activity of people under you that your supervising many of these things apply but that's not precisely what i've tried to focus i want to start talking about some basic goals you should have your conversation in interpersonal uh communication we're talking about communicating with an individual or two maybe three people at once and here's some basic goal that you can keep in mind by trying to make your conversations and your interpersonal uh communication more effective these are not easy go they take some time and effort and focus but i think by keeping these ideas in mind and tried to maintain this orientation you could really improve your conversational interpersonal communication first you want to focus on description none evaluation and talking to people you weren't communication you don't wanna be evaluating other people you wanna be exchanging information telling people what you think what you know uh you know and you want to you know let the professors give out the grades or let the work evaluated evaluated the work you don't necessarily want to do that i think it could be a real problem if you are too ready to exhibit disapproval of something that people have done i think that should be done in a different setting in a more formal way uh with some warning but uh you know i i think you don't want to be too quick with disapproval describe the the things you see describe what's happening but don't necessarily evaluate save that for a different situation second i think you want to be concerned about problem solving not control about problems so you want to solve problems that's the most important thing in the work environment it's worked as important as the test is getting the job done not necessarily as important is you know establishing the pecking order or establishing you're the one who's in charge or that you know you're the one who knows most or something like that that may make you feel good and the short term but it doesn't help your communication with other people and it doesn't really help get the job that you wanna focus on problem solve other people have needs and concerns you have any concerns you may have resources they have resources are and you serve them by giving them opportunities suggesting ideas you don't wanna be hurting people like cattle you don't want to be trying to get people to do what you want you want to be always focused on solving the problem and when other people you know try to indicate that they want to control things don't be afraid to suggest that well look if we just solve the problem if we just do our work effectively will all be better off so second focused on problem solving not controlled third try to be spontaneous not to strategic try to be spontaneous not to strategic each interaction is different each person is different and you want to be spontaneous and your reaction to the person and the situation have ideas have impressions but don't have one set strategy don't decide before conversation right there's the strategy i'm going to use this is this is what i'm going to get done you need to be more more flexible than that you need to be open to the idea that things might change i envy different even if you do have a strategy spontaneous as possible and be willing to adjust and change that that that that strategy react to what's happening though just continue on with the course that you set already for empathy show empathy towards those around you want people to think that you're on if they're expressing that they have problems you should be concerned with that you should you should express that you understand how they feel and what they may be going through it's very important to give people the impression that you're on you're you're on their side you can identify with their situation and you're trying to help them if people have feelings recognize that they had those feelings show that you appreciate those feelings show people that you care about them you want to build a feeling of conrad ship in the workplace in your professional involved not just i i'm neutral i am a computer i do know people are attracted to that people want to think that you're that you're concerned about them and you're on their side this will make them more concerned about you it'll make them more open towards you it'll make them more tolerant towards you try to show empathy for the situation that other people are in fifth and finally you want to have a a a representation of yourself as an equal to that you don't want to try to be established your superiority as i said the golden working professional environment is to get the task or not to establish some kind of pecking order some kind of social hierarchy you want to indicate that you are working together and the best way to indicate working together is indicated equal relationship even if you don't have necessarily an equal relationship maybe you get paid more maybe you have more responsibility or whatever that doesn't mean that you don't want to indicate to them that you are like them that you're a team player that you appreciate them don't try to come across as your the expert and they're the you are just another person you're very much like that you may have more information you may have different ideas but you're still just a person like them trying to do a job and while they are different.
That doesn't mean that you don't want to focus on how they are the same in many important so those are five goals that you should try to achieve your conversations you wanna have description none of you want to have problem solving not control you wanna have spontaneity not strategy and you wanna you wanna have empathy not neutrality and you want to have equality not let's talk about some things to keep in mind for creating conversations that work grading conversations that work first thing i want to say is that you need to use your lifting guidelines you need to use lifting all your conversations all your personal communications will be enhanced if you're perceived as being a good listener if you get the maximum out of your conversations by being able to absorb and understand what people are saying and to the extent that people feel that your last name then they're more willing to talk to you to share information used to be a good listener and it will help make people want to talk to you in a meaningful way here people out don't interrupt them let them finish.
I know that it's uh it it sometimes when you're in a work environment and you're trying to get things done and you're in a rush you feel if someone's not getting to the point but really it's not very productive i especially want to warn men.
About the problem of interrupting women it can be quite a serious problem or if you are interrupting a women they are used to that and they hated listen to them talk let them finish talking and then i think that uh you'll be a better off.
Make sure you are ready to listen to them make sure you are ready made sure they are ready to listen to you when you talk don't talk to someone unless you think they're ready to listen to ride and usually that means that they have completed talking that you know they have gotten their site out and then it's time for yourself i think that can make things work much better when they have smoking there peas and then there's a pause and then they're ready to listen to you then it's time for you to talk if you get a word in edgewise you interrupt um or something like that that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to listen to doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to understand what you're saying and be attending to it first need to put them in a position to wanna listen to you.
Then you can talk then you get something accomplished i want to talk about information giving in conversation and trying to figure out what people want and what they need and then trying to provide them with what they want and what they need.
They'll be afraid to try to paraphrase what they're saying to you if you're not exactly sure what someone is asking you for or what you think someone needs then you can say so you want to know so you are curious about so you are concerned about don't be afraid to paraphrase rather than not understanding what they're saying you can paraphrase what what they are saying and that will provide a a way for you.
To try to make sure that you're you're you're giving the right information don't guess what they're saying when you're unsure find out whenever possible and people asking for information trying to give options don't try to say okay here's the answer here's the definitive answer don't be afraid to say something like well there a couple of different things we do one of them would be this another one could be this there are a couple of different ways to find this information one of them is over here the other one is over there people options that answers what does this do this helps empowering people in the conversation they have choice they're taking an active role the extent that they feel like they're taking an active role in the conversation they're much more likely to be a meaningful participant give people options not necessarily answers if you do provide some information and you're giving people information to know where it came from the source of the information is this for you is this from your experience did you find someone else is it in the work manual was it in the information that was presented with proposal or the sales contract or whatever tell people the source of information and this will really help boost your credibility it's not just i know it's that i found out it comes from somewhere else and here's what i've got it makes you look like you're not so opinionated but they're using good hard information there'll be afraid to tell people where there's more information uh this is a very useful thing i find it very useful in conversation people asking me and i'll say things like well why don't i email you the links to that one and they send you a copy of that correspondence you can follow up on a conversation with information that you can get you know i find it very very difficult confirmation to give internet lakes or read off email address that's not appropriate for them for that the appropriate for them and say oh why did i send you that information or send you the link that information and you'll be a lot better off okay so when you're giving people information and sharing information with people don't be afraid to paraphrase their needs so what you want to know and then they'll say yes or no people options not answers let people know where you've got this information and you know be willing to tell them how they can learn more er get more information and you might do that any context that's not necessarily a conversation finally i want to talk about some basic conversation components are things you want to keep in mind things that sort of make the conversation process a little easier and once again here we're talking about conversation in business and professional contacts we're not necessarily talking about an everyday conversation about your favorite football team or how your problem tomatoes are doing a business and professional contacts and some things.
That i think are very important for you to keep in mind first take turns take turns listening and talking we neither one role or the other when you're lifting listen actively weight to talk until the time for you to talk until there is an open until they're ready to listen right.
Don't be doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo like some kind of electronic pong match that's not useful for conversation to be useful it needs to be since maybe it needs to be extended little especially in business and professional contacts so don't be afraid to take turns listen then talk then go back to listening of knowledge others don't be afraid to use their names in conversation this make things seem more personal the first time you've talked to someone always introduce yourself and ask who they are insane glad to get to know you every first conversation should start that knowledge others you know that they're important that they're individuals that they're meaningful focus on the personal dimension of the other person your unique they're unique they have ideas you have ideas they are an individual person they have experience they have things have gone through that they've gather information you know they may have been in a similar work situation as this or worked on a similar project and you wanna recognize that whenever possible whenever you think you know that they have something in their past experience that they can contribute to say that makes sure recognize that well i know you.
Involved in sales for quite a while so what would you do in this situation right if you know that they have experience er expertise say that say you have a lot of experience here you probably know about this and so that makes it indicates a to them that they are important they are unique there's a personal dimension every conversation business in professional setting maybe about the business or the profession or something like that that's going on but that doesn't mean that it's not personal at the same time there isn't a personal dimension to this conversation excuse me i'm going to call you and don't be afraid to establish some kind of common interests oh i see you have a young family as well or or uh you know do you live in that part of town or you know oh i see you are a fan of the team or whatever create common interests that create personal connections yes we work together yes we have a task relationship but overall relationship transcends that you know we both go to church on sunday we both don't go to church on sunday or whatever but creating a personal connection can help to extend in deep and your business and professional relationship focus on the other person try not to be so focused on yourself be focused on them be yourself as someone who's trying to meet their needs and in doing so to accomplish the task you have an focus on the other person not so much on yours.
So if you're perceived as being me me me i'm the one that's most important me me there's no room for you then you're not necessarily the kind of person that they would like to work you're not necessarily.
Uh the person that they're willing to be open with going to be most cooperative with but the more that people perceive of you as being interested in them and in helping them the more they want to work with you the more they want to collaborate with you and the deeper your conversations interpersonal relationships are likely to be when you ask questions to ask open ended questions questions that allowed them to talk too often we focus on yes or no do you think they're going to accept this offer yes or no right instead of better way to ask questions might be what do you think their reaction to this offer will be how do you think are strategies in this business offer will come across to them to the extent that you offer an open ended question it is easier for someone to answer they are more comfortable answering their life to give you more sensitive information as well as likely to deep end the conversation to go on to discuss things on less of a surface level and more of a detailed as open ended questions.
Don't try to invalidate them don't try to validate them leave the judgement for some on a judgment day you are working with the person you're working you are stuck with you need to make the most out of the conversation and the interpersonal relationship with you do that by trying to you know indoors them and uh from not by invalid dating often we're tempted to invalidate others because it makes us feel better about ourselves i guess i showed her that i'm the one who knows what's going on here yes that may have been validated that yes it may have some way validated you but didn't necessarily help to solve the problem and it didn't necessarily make them want to work with you on a deeper in more meaningful level don't invalidate whenever possible from them because it makes them more open and more receptive to the extent that you are from people on a regular basis then at times when you do want to make suggestions about how things should be done differently they may be more likely to list don't try to change other people's business and professional communications setting at least kind talked about is not a therapeutic when you are not evaluating all their shortcomings and trying to change or rehabilitate them through some kind of professional therapy that you can provide the focus should not be changing the people around the focus should be on creating a positive working environment and then getting the task accomplished finally i wanna say something's important to them trying to make it important to you or at least don't mean things that are important to them if they're various things about office work environment procedure that important to them don't be little them even if you don't agree with that dumpy little it uh if you do have a chance to indicate why it's important that is okay to show your agreement you don't have to lie to them about what you think's important i think if they think something's important then i think you should probably try to avoid that and make it seem important because it's challenging them communications sessions setting and it can be harmful to your overall relationship so in thinking finally about conversations take turns listen then talk acknowledge that others are important use their names introduce yourself don't be afraid of a personal dimension to recognize that people are unique and different important if there are common interests you can try to create a personal communication connection focus on the other person not necessarily on you ask open ended questions try to avoid invalid dating others when you can actually validate from them don't try to change people you want to get the job done businesslike like professional way you don't have time to try to rehabilitate others and finally if something's important to them especially don't be a little bit of a chance to make it important to you.
Fine because it gives you shared interests when we keep these basic things in and try to provide them to enter personal communication and conversational settings then our everyday communicative interactions will be much more productive and much more useful and will be much more successful in accomplishing what we're trying to do things for less.
