0.270000	11.300000	i think it's under this law i'm like
11.300000	231.050000	talk about what we can do about the most important thing it originally in two thousand four thousand for for myself and my throat and we're for our whole campaign for testing laboratories some your whole lifetime and just like santa cruz right now it wasn't like anything you would normally consider illegal hadn't told anybody or burn down the buildings are engaged in any kind of property destruction i'm rather they paid under the only talk about where where are you from originally had back in nineteen ninety two and the original version of law that if you commit a crime of magnitude or something like an or or or serious property destruction against an enterprise which many companies use animals profit and of cost that company over ten thousand dollars in damages your guilty that separate federal telling 'em which itself is rather ridiculous 'cause you're actually being punished for having what you are good moral reasons for committing a crime in other words if someone were to break into your house television or reading on your television breaking and entering robert if someone were to break into laboratory because they had a report that monkeys being abused laboratory well they're guilty of rodriguez insane and they're also guilty to separate federal felonies and another three years in federal prison because they're doing what they're doing out of out of what they see as a a good reason that it was ever tried one or two thousand four ninety just a couple of weeks before myself for under the last censorship committee much to talk about now you know they're not willing to uh trying to cover anything illegal going on okay that wasn't relevant we've had stopped his campaign so i can't have you thought that was pretty hard question was how to do it for me to come up with was using this they remind in two thousand four and no longer was that you had committed primary do now you can also physically disrupt the operation and nobody really knows what exactly physical structures means uh you know more than i do design coverage that any kind of legitimate protesting and that's exactly the point where if i have to be very you don't really know if you're breaking up or not that's exactly what to do was also going to make what we're doing which had previously been illegal illegal um like any find themselves on losing team and change the rules in the middle of the game weren't doing anything illegal or we'll just breaking the law says they are probably played we were arrested and um the government came to work with is very an amount of evidence just like what's going on right now in santa cruz where they had that ridiculous amount of resources investigation about two and a half years at one point over a hundred and federal agents working or are they don't do that again you know we've done anything traditionally legal because we had all anybody buildings on fire damage any property invasion above ground campaign campaign as aggressive camping uh we went camping was august of noxious lately
231.050000	235.920000	mhm um
235.920000	341.880000	they actually the corporate the that we heads the thousands of emails over eight thousand i'm really there is anything against myself and i could have been overseas in federal prison one years six years i started a little under your back on the streets now a couple of my friends will be out soon the other folks have one year two years and years from right now they're gonna see where they're going to be freedom of the question is why didn't time because they certainly wasn't the only campaigning is going on in the country they're selling campaign going at on any given time and the reason i believe was really we were in fact uh we were winning which is something that um of course we always when but what was really campaign was the attitude we documents also too you stay on the sidelines and we get this mindset we can't when we we we have a protest every week and we can we know we're not going to win but at least we can talk about ourselves because we're trying even though we leave it to last or would you leave us alone so how many people going the animal racing within like the only one that's fine i um i do that and the attitude that we're not going to stand in front of our side and you better be we were going to do whatever it takes to win okay we're going to say where we're going to plant and we're not going to stop until we as a result of that actually right now in lifetime is over a hundred million dollars in that um there's a there's a lot of that
341.880000	356.850000	they were getting right now um
356.850000	359.150000	it's not that in
359.150000	510.690000	i i raised theories that we're powerful beyond measure and that's true for freedom isn't losing winning they're afraid that we can't change and that's an awful lot of responsibility on your shoulders knowledge you can't change world just a few days ago i tell me that you know we can't change will never change and that's that's losing you're going to lose if i can change every day you changed the world even if you don't want to change the world you're gonna change the world you can do everything you're you're still going to change the world every every actually don't take every did you say you are changing world never ever believe you can't change the world because you've changed your that's the idea that this campaign and it's the playing field because we're not supposed to have power justify we're not gonna for nothing powerful nobody else's campaign in the movies are rock star politician or millionaire average people were students were blue collar workers were teachers were bus drivers you name it a small group of average people people who are supposed to over major corporations that we're supposed to tell them to corporations what they can and can't do it like that idea that's why that's why we're being prosecuted um and that's that's what it comes down to the notion that we can we say that the way we set up with the mindset i yes we're gonna win it's not going to u._c. santa require sacrifice a lot of hard work but yet we can in fact when um you do you do it so that gets me to what you guys can do about the situation down in santa cruz people always hear about our what is it that can be to help what can i do um to make a difference in what's going on and certainly raising money for the defense is is important that's what really matters to keep fighting that what you can do to a couple of good activists taken off the streets and they can't do what they do any more we need other people to step up and it doesn't matter what kind of accidentally leaving okay whether you work within the system or outside the system where they use most conservative you whatever you need the most effective way to achieve animal liberation keeps sliding do more and we will thank you
510.690000	520.460000	or not you know you know that that is
520.460000	526.590000	well you know even if we
526.590000	566.130000	hey you're even if the conditions aren't great roof over my head i clean water uh i still had enough food to saint louis and that's more than most people have yeah it actually really good um federal prisons or not uh they're demanding that they serve a vegetarian options at every meal and it's not always but about seventy five percent of the time it is and what happened to be a very different we had a couple so they they knew how to do it it was it was good
566.130000	586.530000	i'm sure
586.530000	602.040000	the red scare but some of the things in the campaign vilified developed by animal rights
602.040000	652.830000	are um maybe because they were when is that they're nice otherwise people and they're republican i'm moving will get up and tell you really pays attention to that um we're extremes in every way reason every way a trading here people are just really not um
652.830000	665.420000	eastern scare use overarching
665.420000	670.980000	yeah yeah yeah
670.980000	728.560000	leave the protests if you're gonna obviously that's not true in a normal amount resources trial and they're spending equal amount of resources in santa cruz drop the idea that they're working on is well some of the local people know recognizable public of pain and grass and everyone else um the way back you don't get here so if you're in a position where you're in danger of that level of friendship you know um we certainly no years before we were um if you are protesting you knew you know so you're not gonna wind up in federal prison for doing that if you're an organizer some import 'em you're going to know if you're in danger and hopefully you know how to handle it and even my like worst case scenario let him go right now i'm fine i'm standing here
728.560000	757.520000	well not that important thing is that's how it works yeah that's the point if you want to just shut up when they play limitations on you know that um
757.520000	761.440000	i received offensive one year one year supervised release
761.440000	799.830000	um and during that pregnancy i was surprised that um but once you're up and we are so when i do feel very important in the future just moving all the butter women's rights labor right we're right near any moving into regrets music in lottery as of right now
