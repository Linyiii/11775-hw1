talk about what we can do about the most important thing it originally in two thousand four thousand for for myself and my throat and we're for our whole campaign for testing laboratories some your whole lifetime and just like santa cruz right now it wasn't like anything you would normally consider illegal hadn't told anybody or burn down the buildings are engaged in any kind of property destruction i'm rather they paid under the only talk about where where are you from originally had back in nineteen ninety two and the original version of law that if you commit a crime of magnitude or something like an or or or serious property destruction against an enterprise which many companies use animals profit and of cost that company over ten thousand dollars in damages your guilty that separate federal telling 'em which itself is rather ridiculous 'cause you're actually being punished for having what you are good moral reasons for committing a crime in other words if someone were to break into your house television or reading on your television breaking and entering robert if someone were to break into laboratory because they had a report that monkeys being abused laboratory well they're guilty of rodriguez insane and they're also guilty to separate federal felonies and another three years in federal prison because they're doing what they're doing out of out of what they see as a a good reason that it was ever tried one or two thousand four ninety just a couple of weeks before myself for under the last censorship committee much to talk about now you know they're not willing to uh trying to cover anything illegal going on okay that wasn't relevant we've had stopped his campaign so i can't have you thought that was pretty hard question was how to do it for me to come up with was using this they remind in two thousand four and no longer was that you had committed primary do now you can also physically disrupt the operation and nobody really knows what exactly physical structures means uh you know more than i do design coverage that any kind of legitimate protesting and that's exactly the point where if i have to be very you don't really know if you're breaking up or not that's exactly what to do was also going to make what we're doing which had previously been illegal illegal um like any find themselves on losing team and change the rules in the middle of the game weren't doing anything illegal or we'll just breaking the law says they are probably played we were arrested and um the government came to work with is very an amount of evidence just like what's going on right now in santa cruz where they had that ridiculous amount of resources investigation about two and a half years at one point over a hundred and federal agents working or are they don't do that again you know we've done anything traditionally legal because we had all anybody buildings on fire damage any property invasion above ground campaign campaign as aggressive camping uh we went camping was august of noxious lately

they actually the corporate the that we heads the thousands of emails over eight thousand i'm really there is anything against myself and i could have been overseas in federal prison one years six years i started a little under your back on the streets now a couple of my friends will be out soon the other folks have one year two years and years from right now they're gonna see where they're going to be freedom of the question is why didn't time because they certainly wasn't the only campaigning is going on in the country they're selling campaign going on at any given time and the reason i believe was really we were in fact uh we were winning which is something that um of course we always when but what was really campaign was the attitude we documents also too you stay on the sidelines and we get this mindset we can't when we we we have a protest every week and we can we know we're not going to win but at least we can talk about ourselves because we're trying even though we leave it to last or would you leave us alone so how many people going the animal racing within like the only one that's fine i um i do that and the attitude that we're not going to stand in front of our side and you better be we were going to do whatever it takes to win okay we're going to say where we're going to plant and we're not going to stop until we as a result of that actually right now in lifetime is over a hundred million dollars in that um there's a there's a lot of that

i i raised theories that we're powerful beyond measure and that's true for freedom isn't losing winning they're afraid that we can't change and that's an awful lot of responsibility on your shoulders knowledge you can't change world just a few days ago i tell me that you know we can't change will never change and that's that's losing you're going to lose if i can change every day you changed the world even if you don't want to change the world you're gonna change the world you can do everything you're you're still going to change the world every every actually don't take every did you say you are changing world never ever believe you can't change the world because you've changed your that's the idea that this campaign and it's the playing field because we're not supposed to have power justify we're not gonna for nothing powerful nobody else's campaign in the movies are rock star politician or millionaire average people were students were blue collar workers were teachers were bus drivers you name it a small group of average people people who are supposed to over major corporations that we're supposed to tell them to corporations what they can and can't do it like that idea that's why that's why we're being prosecuted um and that's that's what it comes down to the notion that we can we say that the way we set up with the mindset i yes we're gonna win it's not going to u._c. santa require sacrifice a lot of hard work but yet we can in fact when um you do you do it so that gets me to what you guys can do about the situation down in santa cruz people always hear about our what is it that can be to help what can i do um to make a difference in what's going on and certainly raising money for the defense is is important that's what really matters to keep fighting that what you can do to a couple of good activists taken off the streets and they can't do what they do any more we need other people to step up and it doesn't matter what kind of accidentally leaving okay whether you work within the system or outside the system where they use most conservative you whatever you need the most effective way to achieve animal liberation keeps sliding do more and we will thank you
