196.980000	518.610000	and so the new mail was built and instead of grinding on for the farmers the mailbox and pay for all we sold all the flowers the or not just one but many many emotions out of each ten which the the mother for his good management received one quarter of a bushel mr scott and the other investors received and john and his helpers whereas now here male and the other seven and three quarter marshal's that's works so well for everybody that the money partners the investors began putting part of their share back in the business as a result more jobs remain more grain was brown and the company grew bigger and stronger and that's the more money also he bought a fine house to ride in he worked only from daylight does and had a pseudo star clothes and even meet on the table twice a week and that's for john his health he had a house with two rooms good food and yes a sunday so the other person had as much as john and no one had to work so hard anymore because there was a new fangled thing called automatic machinery coming into use by twelve hour days a man could produce enough flower to have all day sunday to themselves as the years more on succeed the old mother john grew or two but the girl easier machinery that many of the hardest jobs now and the lowest helper because he can produce more with the machine with his two hands live better than the old himself ever enjoy the male prospered soda the farmers instead of selling or a hundred and they sold a thousand ten thousand and with the money they got from selling more weight they began to buy more the products of industry and the years go by john sons and his health sons and the sons of the money partners and many newcomers carried on the business there was a new now called heartless carrying somebody who is now the head had one here and their mother's helper could be hard to say that he expected to own one sunday then came a day one depression men became scared and not only did many foolish things made equally fully statements over production they cry system is all wrong make america now wait a minute this was in nineteen hundred and seven but with all the mistakes all the human weaknesses of nineteen hundred and seven progress kept on the when the mother's helper drove cars to work on radio set and the passing crowds became impossible to distinguish between the men who worked in the mail and the miller himself and so it was the farmers to step by step as the male prospered the farmers got more money until they like the mother and his health automobiles and radios and electric lines and the other conveniences tomato farm life easier and happier today and industry the money invested the backup each way job gives him more better tools to work with and the resources of science and industry working together make it possible for him to produce more more no wonder the american work has become the highest paid in the world was the greatest amount of leisure time no wonder to consumers have benefited through the production continually better at lower prices it seems so natural but sometimes you and i aren't fully aware of the past industrial congress which we take park for instance yes sir this is the latest nineteen fourteen muscle bargain to five thousand two hundred dollars today we have far superior cars that an average cost around seven hundred dollars and the result twenty four times as many passenger cars world in america last year in nineteen hundred and fourteen that's what happens when they make better product at a price more people can say here's the family's pride and joy and nineteen twenty four cost around two hundred dollars and they set far better than that one can be bought for as little as twenty dollars result millions of and used today and what these industries has been repeated in almost every one you are i can name with the results more comfort luxuries are certainly being made available to more people and so this is the pattern of american progress the only way to get ahead workers management and money part striving together to produce a product more people can say that they succeed all of us have more the good things like higher standards of living
