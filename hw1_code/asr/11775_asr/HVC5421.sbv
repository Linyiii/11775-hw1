hey i'm gonna give you a quick to our basement where were you in the middle of having a basement water proofing system in salt lake systems we have a small which was a little bit of water and and we decided that since we wanted to ultimately refinish basement made a lot of sense to actually have a proper water proofing system installed now before it was finished so the guys have been here all day let's see what they've done first of all we've got this metal cutting down the walls which is actually an insulation there and it also inside so this law started from the inside the water will come through and we'll run down the inside of this metal coding and you'll see that the metal coding actually goes all the way around the basement so it's down on the other side there as well and this is what it looks like up close and ah see on the inside their system channels that channel the watered down so that it goes all the way down to the book now all the way around the bottom we've got this channel that they've actually cut out of the cement and they're gonna be installing a drain and some moral which will pick up the water that comes down the wall and pull into the drain and then the drain actually goes all the way around the basement here so you'll see it here that's actually the main water supply right they're coming in from the outside so it goes around there there's a big role of the mental insulation and then at the bottom here comes around goes across the bottom of this door here which leads to the outside of the front of our house and they'll be putting in a special rate there that runs across the bottom of the door so any water ever comes in from the outside going this way it'll get picked up by the train comes around here underneath the sink and then that will be where our knew being located and you'll see that there's a that that's gonna be drain which runs up here parallel to that went over there and then through this wall here and out through the outside of the house so it's very important outside and don't go into your plumbing stock the city in fact is so intent on having people do that they're doing refunds too people do and uh haven't run through the outside of the house rather than through the and so that's our plumbing in so far and we'll check in tomorrow and see how they wrap everything up
