she likes to demonstrate the bench press a written very important to us we're trying to get a wider area so that we can get more chance involved because just the muslims and will give you a better bench press about the whole process look look at me and i agree that we are on the floor he's pushing on speed especially like on the going to help them take it out because he didn't want to expand energy taken out he didn't want to lose his good position to have it out here and as easy as it is just talking about that's fun that's your nipples straight straight up again let me talk about those strategy or this was not hard i might start pretend the typical average dollars on him he's going to let things inclined back a little bit i usually that's gonna help him get through those hard reps sneak back over and that will allow him to finish
