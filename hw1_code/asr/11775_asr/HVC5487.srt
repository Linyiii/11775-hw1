see i just walked in my garage which apparently leftover last night and i told my trash can with and everywhere has this situation ever happened to you while lightly candidate this catastrophe than a raccoon raccoon well i've seen several of my lifetime i like to share a little bit more about them including some things raccoons are medium size north american animals they're feral and intelligence you should probably regardless caution i'd like to tell me a little bit more some general description of them kind of where they live and what they look like some eating behaviors and more on their capability and general nature of their personality raccoons as i said already common medium sized there needs to north american uh they had the thing face markings as you can see it looks like a mask and they also have brings on the tail which you can also notice right they're um they're not very large they typically between twelve fifty pounds um they have five fingers on each other on their hands and you can actually tell what their look like because they have a friend of their hind legs looks approximately like humans footprint on your toes and they're smaller obviously i'm jonathan during a writer for an outdoors magazine says that they live all over in north america except like even down to mexico maybe even as far as panama except i'm not coal region which is really far north up into alaska in canada in a mountainous region or raccoons or opportunities so like eat all kinds of things there are are still pretty much anything humidity and i'm also something that human would not eat like three nights frogs muscles little fish bugs small birds and turtles and eggs and pretty much any other smaller countries commands catch or they live generally in the wild along because one of their favorite things to which they grab the water very quickly with they're very um and in captivity they also if you're in because they want to feel like there hunting which are in their last name which means the washer um their name raccoon actually comes from native american word which roughly transmit translated means he scratches with his teens uh raccoons are intelligent and they can even adapt to urban environment if they want to use the same motor skills and the manual dexterity that they use to catch crayfish in order to do lots of things that i kinda think is kind of they they have more sensory receptors in their fingers in typical animals and they have excellent memories so they use to do things like um walk complex latches and locking mechanisms and also get into all the colors camp sites and enjoy your trash cans um typically typically but sometimes they band together an urban environment causing a more major problems one newspaper canadian newspaper uh cleans recorder that a group of raccoons terrorize a community in the city uh olympia washington and which they killed several cats and some dogs and even a a woman who now says she carries around with their everywhere he goes oh carry rabies alive they have the most confirms uh they're the most confirmed cases rabies and any other than any other animals so if you wanted a pet then you first find out that it's legal for you and your state and you should also make sure that you can get them vaccinated because rabies and raccoons has an incubation period for over a month so they are sometimes can have even when they appear uh dangerous at all since summary north america are smart food if you let them and they'll give you rabies if they bite you you've learned a lot more aware of raccoons and i hope you respect thank you
