mhm my computer just every found yourself and i've been there i really have um just a personal experience and i found that through centered recovery groups that it really does help mentally and physically to go through the process of this first found out that price center recovery of workers for better help overall for mental stability and physical life that god created for us to live and they're just so many surroundings recovery groups in general period and one of them is that uh the research from colorado state university from three different things that there's just some struggles that people just feel that the one on one with with her sometimes that group therapy at accountability to other people really does help and it's just getting that communication skills enter personal connection going that really does help another massive that people think of the group leader actually gonna be the therapist and that's not the case 'cause the group to group leaders are actually there just to be the facilitators to be the help to get the group going the participants actually are the ones that actually do the work to help each other through the process of feeling and another one is that people think that my reputation somebody people are going to go out and tell everybody everything about me confidentiality situation there that will not be breached just because of ethical standard alone opposite it's gets lost so i'm the type to recover groups that most people are aware of or addiction based a for instance i alcoholics anonymous ah which is a our men and women who share their experiences strikes and hope with each other that they may solve a problem to help with their alcoholism helping healing process and then similar fellowship with individuals who through shared experience strength and hope a recovering from overeating um but there's a different side to the groups of people overlook enough pressure recovered covers at all um one in particular celebrate recovery started by john baker who was an alcoholic and he was seeking out a way that he could harmonize his addiction focus on christ not affiliated with his addiction himself he couldn't find a place to share his victory and freedom over passes in christ was giving him a recovery program that was centered and based on the bible other people probably be looking for something else like that too and i got some recovery website a lotta people also overlook the whole spiritual health connection um just in general so group therapy a lotta people according to baylor university eighty percent of people actually affiliate themselves with the christian faith but a lot of them including medical professionals researchers and just basic individual just don't connect christ christian perspective on him and there's medical scriptural evidence that it does work just therapy in general um according to the the face and health connection um chronic and stress unhealthy coping mechanisms contribute to your health overall medically speaking and the american psychological association had documented consequences poorly managed stress um deal with the part of a heart disease and obesity the scriptural factory also find the first time to seventeen desires passed away but the who does the love of god lives forever and a lotta people don't realize serious truth in woman's three twenty three twenty four all seem to follow the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace redemption that came through christ jesus as christians were still we still need to increase in price wise so inclusion you can take initially to help further along your progress into uh mentally and physically active life healthy life is realizing that you're and admitting that your power schedule your tendency to do the wrong thing that your life is manageable you honestly believe that god exists and that he has the power to help you recover consciously choose to commit all your life to christ will control period that comes from celebrate recovery for three steps so today what we've covered is recovering support groups are differences between addiction based recovery groups and cry centered recovered and also have to start learning to find humor in your own for to live healthier joyful life we must be to listen to ourselves others in god we are eating and he help in eighteen and i encourage three for you today so all of this whole heartedly seek out your own hurts hang ups and habits to someone else to say something god seek out across recovered with time
