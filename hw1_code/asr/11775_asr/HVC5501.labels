7.140000	485.310000	irresponsible twice many americans me the results like changes today to inform my parents of the danger of driving the influence of drugs or alcohol i having a drink or two some people do not think twice before grabbing their teeth and getting behind the wheel vehicle sometimes they don't realize how effective they really are throughout the evening they had a beer and to take a shot once or twice it's all mixed at the moment right having the time with their friends they shouldn't really be doing is finding that the drivers finding someone that won't be drinking and they can give them if they drive home and sit up expecting later on city silver enough to drive home everyone around them they're fine you know they can marry these c- they can walk in a straight line that's fine truth of the matter is their vision is impaired speeches slurred and have delayed reaction time they don't quite understand what is going on around them when they're walking they can't do this especially when they're driving the track or does not know that there are alcohol related motor vehicle accident every thirty minutes in the united states america for every two minutes their injuries and accidents so curry every two minutes someone in this in this country is getting into an accident because of drunk driving drunk driving is carolyn immature extremely irresponsible whether the driver takes their own life life innocent bystander just would not have happened if they had a little smarter if they listen to someone else or better listen to themselves these would not need to occur thousands and thousands of people die each year because drunk driving accident in two thousand five alone sixteen thousand eight hundred and eighty five people died because of motor vehicle accident for drunk drivers job other than alcohol make up for eighteen percent of the accidents that year more than half of the four hundred and fourteen child passengers who died alcohol related united states were riding with a drunk driver it's insane why why would they like innocent child needs to be taken from parents or someone else having either a child's a new car after they've been drinking for somebody else on the road driving while intoxicated people don't really understand it is illegal to drive the blood alcohol content level of zero point zero eight percent or higher and this includes all fifty states in the united states in two thousand five fifteen percent drivers age sixteen twenty died in motor vehicle crushes under the age the drinking alcohol we all know that it's not impossible for a minute to get their hands on some like it's not impossible but they're obviously not being taught enough dangerous they are not being shown what happens after drinking and driving at any level of blood alcohol concentration the risk of being involved in a crash is greater for younger people that older so alcohol hits a sixteen year old much harder than it was someone who say thirty years old but they don't know that's that's the problem you need to be informed of these these these statistics needs to be out there another statistic that most people don't know about it smells drivers are almost twice as likely as female drivers to be intoxicated blood alcohol concentration there or hire someone a man say thirty years old and a woman they couldn't drink the same amount but it will hit that man twice as hard to fix that woman however creating effective measures to rent injuries and that's from driving lower the drunk driving too extreme amount there will be such such much much less that because because of that we need to step up and do our part and help other uniform others aggressively forcing the zero point zero eight percent p._a._c. concentration level minimum drinking ages and and having tolerance for people under twenty one missile enable better drivers on the road we'll get to have more consequences i think makes a bigger than people you know if you're caught drunk driving say no i just pulled over you should go to jail and you lose your licence immediately there should be at first or second chance i mean maybe a first chance at the most if it's very low but we don't want the people on the road these are friends and loved ones out there and they're getting killed every day because of those who are irresponsible i think the drivers that are arrested for d._u._i. should have their license suspended for like years also there should be random sobriety checks throughout throughout the states often especially on holidays and saturday nights because that me i know so many people that had happened to them at the time i now another person is getting into an accident because of drunk driving i know someone who has a one year old child and he had a d._u._i. white when he was younger and now he cannot drives his child daycare you're not driving child to the doctor and luckily he could even walk he didn't get into an accident he didn't hurt anyone else that the humans irresponsible and he drank now you have to learn the hard way and it's extremely side for him i know another friend her first year of college she got to president than drinking they got into an accident she she hit a tree and her they had to get get reconstructive surgery on her face because that accident for the rest of her life she's got to deal with that mistake facility other people in her car it's just nice and it really is just son and i think the more information out there and especially with you in high schools the more we can prevent that from happening people have the right to live they should not be killed because somebody else the drinking and driving passes on information to the ones that you are and make sure that everyone you know especially so she's not driving while intoxicated thinking
