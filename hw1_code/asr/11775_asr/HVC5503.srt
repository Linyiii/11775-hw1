hello i like to talk today about linguistic phenomenon scholars referred to what it's a mixture between english and spanish to produce the new bangladesh now depending on where you're from how long you been speaking spanish or how long you been speaking english but today we focus on the floor linguistic components that make it traceable indistinguishable as distinctly those for linguistic component include phonology or the sounds of language or the vocabulary of language syntax another word for the grammatical features that language and pragmatic which means putting it altogether and using it in a social setting when we first full knowledge he we have to understand that the phonology established is actually coming from two not of english and spanish and that all the sounds in spanish do not equal all the sounds in english and vice versa for instance in english we only have we have seventeen about them in spanish we have only five so much simpler and when we make them all together we're going to maybe loose themselves where we should have them and ask them where we shouldn't another example of this is in looking at confidence the confidence um other than that we have an english that's not predominant in spanish spanish speaking person says the word and then they might say then substituting the dust down for the sound that they're not familiar with native phonology interesting mix of sounds comes together again or the vocabulary a spanish to come up with new words we distinguish established we're going to either be taking from spanish into english or english and spanish and adapting to knowledge to make the new word let's start with spanish to english now this back to the early eighteen hundreds travelers left travelling what is now the american was in mexico and the letter home we're finding new words like c._b._s. and avocado and and um tortilla that we took from spanish i'm have adopted into our own english today and looking at how english spanish into spring list we can see let's look at them for parking parking is and it comes from the english park with spanish phonology adapted into it and we get the park a are in spanish not that we can see and how they are are very different but park and they are are very close another example of this is the in spanish close to our english library far from the spanish bit saga but anybody has the english with the spanish phonology added now look at syntax or the grammatical teachers spend much time do we need to look at and code switching when the grammatical features of two languages crossed wires into each other in the same sense it so if the english sentence sounds like you must finish your food in order to play games might sound like that you must finished food for three player games for to play where does that come from we have to look at the spanish grammar to get the answer is that actually have the phrase potter meaning in order to for to play who got we insert that same grammatical feature into english it sounds like you must finished food for to play undercoat switching we see the mix of words phrases or grammar innocence this sound like this i wanted to go to the store or nothing know and that's it half english spanish and we can either answer words or phrases like i just previously to come up with a code switching version of sprinklers and analyzing the pragmatic or the how when where spring they begin to see how some of these elements come together now if you're using speak english this might be intentional or it might be intentional intentionally examples include the musical genre known as radical regulation on is very reliant on code switching to produce a certain effect and the music artists make spanish and english together to get a good flow or in their music and you were seen is very skilled and you can english and spanish together see mostly with them another example is doing adding spinach intentionally would be to add a word or an expression for effects or to change the tone of your dialogue now of course there's also happened intentionally like if i were speaking spanish and i use the word instead of i might not have even realize that i was using instead of spanish word or sometimes were told that if a person is speaking about is difficult memory or um a difficult time they will revert to the second language or perhaps they english to distance between themselves and the events and also if you're speaking and again you just don't have access to a word in the language you may substitute the language or the grammar from the other one as was trying to express yourself so this is a breeze overview of the linguistic phenomenon english analyzing phonology larry grammatical features and the pragmatic or the use of spinach and social setting i hope it's provided you great insight into this linguistic phenomenon it shows you the interesting things that can happen when two languages come together to form one thank you
