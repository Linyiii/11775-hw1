Hello do they like to tell you a story it's a personal story and it comes with a warning warning i hope you will he was an ordinary friday just like any other and i was in the grocery store picking up a frozen pizza have for dinner and some other items and i'm going to check out when it comes time to pay my debit card won't go through it start started worker comes over to help me put it through their console it will go through now i'm starting to get more panicky because i know i've just been paid through direct deposit and there's money in the account and i don't understand what's going on i leave the groceries and russia i started calling my bags customer service and my count on line now the information is coming up on the screen i noticed something terribly wrong my had been wiped out to the tune of nine hundred dollars worth of online purchases i had not authorized now i've heard of identity theft but it's never hit so close to home and i really didn't think it would happen to me i'm sure many of us thinking the same thing right now but i'm here to tell you are closer to your banking credit card uh personal information then you might think i mean how many of us we're banking on line make online purchases retail stores or or amazon dot com even make charity donations on line and you know some people are wary of this kind of these kinds of transactions and i always say oh come on with the twenty first century but now i'm starting to understand where they're coming from after i'd been victimized but let's face it online transactions whether banking or other arm going anywhere they offer the luxury of time in our increasingly busy lives and many of us like therefore it's important that we learned how to combat growing security risk so how do we do that and what is the scope of this well let's get some of the facts fifty billion dollars a year is extracted from accounts and credit cards online annually fifty billion annually and identity so awful now consumer reports are saying that all around the world are saying this is the number one problem that they're dealing with right now cars over credit cards because money comes immediately from the account there's no waiting period for transactions to go through um how do they still information how does that happen well they have passwords stealing software that comes to your computer sometimes in emails and it's disguising the attachment maybe it's a photo or files offering something free you accidently download may insult infiltrate your computer with a virus or may feel some information and send that back to the thief which they didn't have and can use other methods include installing 'em card readers on a._t._m. or gas station palms that take your information right from the cars as you're using it so what do we do well number one always stay on top of your counts check them daily or every other day and if there is any discrepancy is report them immediately so the banks and start working on it never type your p._i._n. number and when you're at the gas pump because that's a notoriously hot spot for stealing pins and card numbers always stick with the a._t._m.s located think if you didn't want off the street or in a restaurant or somewhere like that maybe instill those cards meters lift your information right off of there and send it is recommended that when you do buy online always use a credit card never your debit card to your checking account because that money is yours and when that takes it is gone out of your account with credit cards that money you can always withhold payment if there's any any any discrepancy is an issue suspicious emails delete them don't open them and risk that contains a virus or passwords dealer that's going to send the information off it's terrible when this happened i happened to me i'm hearing more and more stories about it let's look at this one story of a small business owner small business owner responsible for it himself mr greenspan mr he went to pay the count um he's the pc and of his typical laptop um which is which is an apple um most of these programs are written for windows and pcs but not exclusively but he ended up making a failed transaction one day which open access suicide receive now his for a party supplies from based in oklahoma city with the bank over who should pay for the last uh last over ninety thousand dollar stolen from his business account you don't wanna be mr marines so no one would wish the situation on themselves or anyone they care about no matter how safe and secure site that they are no matter how secure anti virus program seem to be you must take precautionary measures and don't take their word for it be aware of the a._t._m.s they were using never offer any information online or on the streets to anyone that might be able to use that information in a way you don't want them to do not pay for anything with your debit card on line and above all i'll stay current with your account report anything that is off immediately the are always all the wheels they're always turning always trying to get ahead of the banks ahead of the programs that are and they're usually had at least a few days and then we the the security measures catch up by then it's too late so he just cautionary tail follow the instructions and you'll never be in the grocery store with no money to pay for your dinner because all your money while you weren't looking thank you.
