1
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:25.130
every movie would be a i really enjoyed the stories in the stores and told the symbolism and just the concept was how it's done the characters it was just real great movie

2
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:33.660
uh i really like um l._a. confidential um say spring love and catch up again

3
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.050
i think that my favorite movie would probably be

4
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:54.190
angels or hanging over my least favorite movie honestly i really don't make enough to watch that movie and i really i can't really say i've seen that movie i wouldn't be able to answer

5
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.660
i hate every movie that has um kevin costner in it

6
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.820
close ties between the blair witch project and

7
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.740
my favorite genre i really like action and the war

8
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.350
um comedy

9
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.360
movies is probably comedy or action i revere robert deniro voice many different characters he can pull up

10
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.600
such excellent and especially like in when once upon a time

11
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.980
i really like um we're dicaprio work

12
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.810
i don't pay attention to the actor's name so i wouldn't really

13
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:50.400
i really wanted to see a movie when i'll be able to go into another world no matter what it is and the best thing about it is another person made another person was capable

14
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.570
bring someone else into another world the story telling us just brilliant and

15
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.110
the thing that makes me want to see a movie is probably the trailers or just

16
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.590
that if i read something about

17
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.900
if my friends really wanna see it or if i like the trailer or the movie i go see it

18
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.150
thing i imagine for the future movies is that

19
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:33.470
i think that they're gonna get like bad movies and occasionally there would be

20
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:49.040
for the future movies there's going to be a lot more original ideas and a lot more people taking original ideas but within they know that tradition of there's definitely going to be a level excellent

21
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:59.860
no matter how it's done they're definitely going to be

22
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.750
um

23
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.510
me
