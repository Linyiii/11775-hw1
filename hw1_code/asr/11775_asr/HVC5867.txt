Hello this is my husband and i just cut his hair and he says it's a little bit short and i kind of it as soon as possible because that was the easiest way to measure.
And kinda longer next time when i want is opinions on i keep cutting hair doesn't really look okay i can't see them doing it by feels turning your head way okay.

Okay so they gave me your opinion number one is it too short and i should make it a little longer next time and number two am i doing an okay job cutting hair or should he find somebody else to cut his hair.
Bye-bye.
