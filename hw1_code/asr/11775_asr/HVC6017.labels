4.200000	695.150000	this last christmas chapel or thought rather than actually prepare like a fallout sermon i would just kind of um some thoughts that i had about a piece of something that we commonly talked about ah during christmas cards and everything so i was reflecting on um the piece of god as we're talking about character attributes of god this year and so i'm just going to read a a bit of the thoughts that i've kinda put down on paper just reflect on so it was christmas eve december twenty fourth nineteen fourteen german troops along the western front began to decorate their trenches in spite of miserable conditions candles replaced on trees and the sound of german soon drifted over no man's land to the ears and the opposing british forces surprisingly english bombarded the germans and reply eventually invitations were both german and british side by side on their battlefield exchanging gifts of whiskey and chocolate and cigars each side was allowed together they're dead give proper barriers for them all they talked to one another exchange addresses and some even played football together it seems as though the words the preacher and ecclesiastical still held true for everything there is a season and a time for everything under having time to love the time to time for war time for peace the christmas or uh seems to have the universal theme peace on earth goodwill towards man some are so audacity to promote this at all times and not just on christmas for instance israel has myself into friends were about to enter our hotel we stopped by women in flowing dress the spirit to match would you like together at the western world hold hands and unite for peace in the middle east we thought a nice gesture we'd also been walking in the heat all day long and various piles of dirt and decided we'd call it a night as the christmas season approaches i've been thinking about this concept of peace and his view from various vantage point what is peace to people for the soldiers fighting in world war one was a cease fire for the woman flowing dress was holding hands and your dating under something for the comfortable middle class family and security and rest for the lower class forgotten that his food from somewhere for the agreement for the american consumer is silence for the older dying is rest my question is this what is to god other word such as purity cleanliness stability can be described as the absence of something as purity cleanliness the absence of filth stability the absence of chaos piece the absence of contention everyone's pursuit of peace indicate about ourselves indicates that humidity isn't bondage to conflict and inflamed by turmoil the pursuit of peace reviews about men that he's disturbed out of joint thoroughly backwards we are now the antithesis of god's creative declaration and what she said all that i've made is very good what he has made has turned very bad and i never ending and never satisfied pursuit of peace is evidence suggest that we know a faithful gracious god for the sake of his own gory was not contempt simply start over for a child is born to us uh son is given the government should be punished shoulder and his name she'll be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace how ironic is that the baby born the prince of peace live the life that's us could characterize nothing of the sort from the moment jesus was born in authority in pursuit of his life was refugee in egypt he was a carpenter he was homeless and he was a controversial rabbi he was a marked man by the religious leaders he was a desperate child in the garden he would say falsely accused convicted and executed political insurrection he was mockery shame held king of the jews a peaceful life you say not even close at least not by our standards and the eyes of god there was no man who lived more peace in the lord jesus christ was the only man whose life warranted god's creative declaration this is my son in whom i am well pleased he was not disturbed joints and backwards the race which he came he was the only display of god's perfection the world has ever known and because of it's broken this world found peace only by removing him from their we like to look at perspective of peace we have no further than to look at his son six the the prince of we know is not simply just peace or prosperity is completeness homeless fullness rightness in harmony with god and he originally intended and what he originally intended selfless worship filled humanity what it was fully love and be fully loved why do so many people have so much really have so little piece short we waited on christmas cards still on tombstone rest in peace but there's one thing certain about humidity is that we are truly void of god's peace peace that comes from dying to self piece which comes from abandoning oneself to pursue the joy of other human beings think about it think about what goes on even subconsciously in your mind on a daily basis how much comparing of yourself to others do you do she got a better grade than me i must be awful this wow what a happy person i wonder if i'm happy to others and i'm glad i'm not wearing that today and he is pretty humble i think other than too right not only do we endlessly compare ourselves one another but we pathetically presume on the character of others to make us feel much better about ourselves you wish you looked at me what's wrong with her now that i've seen who he hangs out with i don't think he cares about very much they don't really care about me they they would act more you hear what she said i can't believe we are as little children stopping around the playground stealing toys and mine was just a little more sophisticated now that we're older are selfish pursuit of promotion can be wrapped in mild just being more serious spiritual dialogue or even the excuse that hey it's just my personality but what we're we are hollow shells the life intended by god a life of true how is that the piece of god was surpasses all understanding will guard our hearts and minds in christ jesus christ jesus we have the basis for peace romans 51 said therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with gone through the lord jesus christ how we heard it wednesday one for him all the god was pleased to dwell and threw him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or been making peace by the blood is cross while the substitution of the perfect satisfied to just rats holy god that's making peace between god man the wait a true peace here on earth is found exemplified and the character of the the reason christ is life is peace is joy is because he is all god intended to be comprehensive we selfless full of worship and eager to put the interests of others before himself he was truly the prince of peace making peace between god man and showing his own character to be the way to true peace on the soldiers the next day went back to fighting holding hands let the middle east same security only last as long as your life live by bread alone agreements will be can be broken consumerism can't be silent unless you know jesus christ dying anything peaceful true peace over the holidays my advice to you is this whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life from i think we'll find it probably costs in the band comes up to play some music father we take the time to humble ourselves before you praise you your name for how you have glorified yourself glorified your son in coming to us in rescuing in delivering us not only from the bondage of sin and the penalty which is separation from you but you saved us from ourselves i pray for this university for myself for the faculty that over the season you would be constantly renewing constantly saving us from our pursuit of our own pleasure in our own gory apart from you i prayed that the true peace that surpasses understanding would be given to us through your gracious hand as a gift that we might enjoy delighting in others rather than ourselves that we might find peace in casting off our own desires and taking on the desires of others is more important but i prefer that kind of peace peace that puts away self that you'd be pleased with the songs we thank you so much for what you have done and i pray that you would continually break our hearts for what breaks yours to make a truly creatures we're not backwards any longer but upright righteous following hard after your ways delighting in you you pray all these things for christ in his name because of his blood
