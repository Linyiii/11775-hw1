unit seven skill process how many syllables do you see in this word how did you determine the number did you divide this word by the number of talking fouls when you did that you were the word we call this the process and the first step is exactly what you did to determine the number of syllables so you underline talking miles and mark them with a me why did you do that to find the number of syllables and so of course you wrote down the number of syllables now you've completed step one of the process step to we're going to swoop between those talking about why are we doing that we want to pull down confidence between talking vowels and when we do that we have found that cutting pattern so we know where to divide in our language we have five cutting patterns and the first one up here in our five is vowel confident confidence vow the very pattern we found and how do you divide that pattern you divided between the two confidence and that takes us two step number three we're going to divide according to the pattern so i'm going to divide right between those confident now why did i do that i did that to find the position of my wow now i'm ready for my next step and my next step is to check i'm gonna check the position of that wow so i can i have a single file and it's closed in at the end of the syllable confident now i can everyone short so i'm going to put the breed above it let's go to the second syllable and i need to check the position of all single closed with a continent so now i can short and now i have marked lifestyles this now takes me two that important stuff and what is that stuff i'm going to unlock each so and then i'm going to sweep my syllables together why am i doing that well to lock the pronunciation of the word so let's do it at tech attic and the attic is that storage room right beneath the rough addict now we have learned the steps for the process so let's review those and we're going to review them was guy riding and i'm going to put the steps in the pocket chart and we will sky right let me move this over a little bit so we can start what is that number one step number one we're going to underline the talking mark them with me do it with me underline the talking mark them with a v. y. to find the number of syllables step number to we're going to swap between talking about and pull down the constant it's between the talk about do that with me between the talking and pull down the confidence between the talk about why define cutting pattern and are cutting pattern is low so what number three yes we're going to divide according to that pattern between those two confidence to this guy riding with meat divide according to our cutting patterns now we're ready for step number four and that is to check we're gonna check we're going to check the position of the fall with me check the position of all why so we can and we saw that we had a closed syllable so we marked short now we're ready for our last step by step number five we went from syllable so and then we swept are syllables to gather why to unlock the pronunciation of the word then of course you need to go to sentence to be sure that you understand the meaning of that word so our five steps for now it's time for you to see if we can check your understanding of that process and you do that with students seven eight and remember you're gonna divide by what the number of talking about and remember your steps steps number one set with me underlying you're talking than with a v. y. define the number of syllables ready for a number two between the talking vowels and pull them confidence between those talking about what have you found your right the cutting pattern next step divide according to the cutting and then check the position of so you can market sweep your syllables together to lock the pronunciation of the word and then read that sentence so that you have meaning for that word now you are ready to finish the rest of the vocabulary words using your five steps or saliva vacation that's now go back to our five five your guide and open it up to s dash too and we are going to fill in the first little section of our five was cutting pattern we worked with in this lesson we're going to record our c- confident c- confident no between the two knees and show where you divide that the c- c- the cutting pattern right between the two confidence
