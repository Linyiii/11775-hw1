1
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:55.460
<#s> oh that's not very long that lasts blower have been able to just produce what they wanna produce it really started around prior to that you people couldn't walk in and go you go to the burning and just create objects and they wanted to make home i'm getting to know that you blow it out yeah starting to to to get now

2
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.040
every piece you know takes an extreme amount of focus

3
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:18.860
very crucial to it makes sense closed down too much then

4
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:46.990
with glass blowing probably with anything it takes an extra amount of discipline to really become fluid and uh accomplished added so with every piece that i'm making a lot of energy into it the energy in the studios is really important to keep keep uh high energy high attitude to be able to perform

5
00:01:46.990 --> 00:02:01.920
just going to be today to make the goal is to make creating a relation to thinking about placing outside studio

6
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.350
i'm really interested in nature and plant life and trees so i thought this would be really great place to set the inflation

7
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:24.150
this one i've got all the color set up now i should start blowing in a way to describe the initial

8
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:51.570
sometimes the walking and i'll see a tree that reminds me of the technique that we learn at this class or the friendship and i go back to the shop and i try to emulate

9
00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:10.750
when i learn a new technique than i am doing it over and over and over into a big learning curve at the beginning it takes a little while to become familiar with it and as you progress then then you get hired

10
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.520
uh

11
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:40.310
oh

12
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.140
overnight to give it a little

13
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.210
leaves are all changing the grass is changing i thought this would be really fabulous place that at all

14
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.760
mm

15
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:15.940
and uh mm

16
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:34.760
i'm really excited about you know whatever i know that i'm going to grow as an artist i'm going to learn and be able to take to the next project or insulation mm

17
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:45.710
yeah yeah

18
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.320
because
