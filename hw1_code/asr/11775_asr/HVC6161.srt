the thing is that um you understand when you took over lifesavers uh the expectation that you're talking about like um some kind of beam of light on that are certainly possibilities in in trying to because for example technologically possibilities and it also fundamental things that that that go beyond that sufficient so even if you wait long enough to try to overcome those technical difficulties you would never be able to do it so what what the when you're talking about the you have issues such as for the simple fact that when you when you talk about the you're talking about something for a certain extent um that kind of happened uh basically when you turn on the front of it being the speed of light done the moment you switched off it it's also at the speed of light conceivable ways of having a short thing uh turn off the later then calculate you know how much they will be in a certain amount of time off right at the moment i'm on off on on off but that would require millions and millions of times of of of for a very large numbers second which in itself has i know fundamental changes but there is a bigger issue which is even though you could conceivably very strong laser or you know if you try to bound to be they're going to go through one and now that i'm absolutely nothing is going to happen because the the equation that go over the behavior of light electromagnetic waves that's what like these are the so there is no interaction between those those you will have the the noises are another another mother to consider but the funny thing is that even though you know do it in in the form that was conceived to the movies with lights that could be some kind of a possibility is completely theoretical completely out of the what these uh which is using something last when you took uh what i'm saying this i can't even imagine people who say no that's not even possible either when you're blessed my my something that is very very some some science fiction type of thing and every time to talk about the nothing bad you're nice thing which and i and like turn on uh state of marketing which was hobbies dissociate electric so you have one fear electron from something on the my t._v. or the too which is a very very energetic things easy to handle but when you have these nice association you have which are positive and they were negative uh becomes electrical activity you can control the with with field so it's pretty simple in principle conceivable that you could generate the shape of some my thing simply by being able to generate the appropriate so you could perhaps some kind of a bar that generates the feel that you guys are bar and you're you're like say now forty two lights saving meaning lightning lied noises and smashing people read them being able to buy into either like we'll have to have a very very very high um that was required tremendous amount of energy on require um it was very very hard on around it uh you know that's what you listen to my cooking it up to electricity you provide the energy necessarily to disassociate the inside of reviews and stuff but you know that little amount of we're talking about huge amount of energy so basically you will carrier device which would be some hooked up to a huge energy generate something i would rather use all this energy so you have to find i mean there is no way you can have the source of energy in the in the handle of right now um i know it will be incredibly hard cook your basic so i said they've eyes uh conceiving at least from a theoretical perspective the notion that you could end up with something that looks like a bar a that lights up on and you can this is kind of interesting theoretical exercise perhaps within the rules of what we can do but the technological to come off now
