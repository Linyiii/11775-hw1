I read somewhere and i don't remember where the average person spent a hundred and fifty one hours a month watching tv this is not indictment of television because let's face it or not for television most people's simple would not know what they know about many subjects world affairs for example however i cannot help but wonder if spending twenty percent of your waking hours watching tv can be all that good when i couldn't find his how many hours the average child spent in nature.
Could be true that forty percent of our children are allergic to the outdoors is going outdoors because they have some sort of allergic reaction maybe that is why it's no longer have an interest in nature.
I have a suggestion how about growing flowers in your own backyard if you have access to a back yard and if you don't have access to a backyard what about collecting the access flowers that hospitals patience leave and they will leave the flowers there why not collect them bring them into your own home and she your children's reaction to flowers and then gradually weans them back to nature afterall aren't these flowers beautiful.
Here's a thought if you're a teenager older teenager young adult perhaps or a senior citizen and you have the time would you volunteer to take some younger kids on a nature walk at least once a week and see if the ducks and the would you do that.
