i enjoy because partially because of the culture it's kind of like hidden secret it's not a lotta people know about it and then the people i do know about it are just so awesome and accepting and love that you know about it that year like instant friend is probably the best carnivals a lotta people think it's like a bunch of hippies in their feet running around around but it's evolved into a lot more still has really relax feel an open friendly atmosphere rich like everybody's involved when you go so tournament and there's there is like older women there and like i don't know it's just so much love the game but i've never seen before anything else you can find ultimate players all over the world to go to the newtown and ultimate player and you tell them that you're in just kind of like understood that you guys are just hit it off make friends are all around the country and it's just like grace important to have you know that you're your college or five
