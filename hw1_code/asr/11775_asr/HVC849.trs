this to me maybe about an hour and fifteen minutes um your time and you use your time why they don't really much time takes about like you just mix everything mean ten minutes and then put them in twenty minutes i think and then you take it out during that time you consider yourself and do the feeling so no and a half an hour first but then after everything is cool and selling it made me take depending on how long you want to you know taking decorating and make it look nice maybe another twenty thirty minutes but altogether more than an hour depending on you know your skill and how fast do things but otherwise it's fairly simple little complicated but it's not at all how much

uh probably a heated server um fifteen to twenty dollars i've actually seen more expensive like other stores um it's it's kinda sad that healthy things to be so expensive but like this we go even from fifteen to thirty dollars it's uh it's funny because it's healthy it's you know it has you know hurt your body you know you're gonna pay for it if you do at home you know it costs too much no more than maybe five or six dollars altogether italian

very good question but it's also very simple questions we are called to do everything dies and we're living in the last the and is going to try to make an insult on upon our mind and the in our mind and if we do not eat health food and keep our body fit be weak online will not be able to make rational and correct decision and that is one of the major reasons why i eat only began because it seems that when i eat and other things that are have been contaminated such dairy in the middle and i'm a meat meat products all it does is of my system i cannot think properly and i cannot be able to communicate with my lord and savior so it's very important that nutritious foods that isn't abundant in all the vitamins and minerals that i'm from my body and i get the carbohydrates and the protein and when i get this balance nutrition that is a a found owning a vegetables then my body will feel great and i feel great and do the rest of the in my mind is clear i mean and be able to discern spiritual thing because your health is when when you are healthy are you able to discern spiritual things because your mind will not be though will be clear and the holy spirit communicate but if it's that's why it's very important to see if your mind and your body all services it may be able to teach you use
