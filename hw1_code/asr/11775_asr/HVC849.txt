Hello this is franklin i'm with my friend police and and and i was also a very delicious that i don't know if i want to eat but anyway um i want to lead to explain a little bit about what he did to make this case.
Okay well this is a very simple consistent apartments cake the cream and then express ourselves which we make a of a cat and i'm a coffee substitutes are made on roasted barley and everything like that is very simple just a plain whoa wait a little bit of white flour i'm just white cake and then you have your your feeling which is a base of coconut tofu and um they and some other with sauce mixed into it and then we just we put the first and then you put your share of that we may express softer and then we put it his cream again another layer of cake with the sauce over the cake again and then you put the cream over the time and just sprinkle some uh and you have a simple procedure that looks delicious taste great.
Okay how long did it take to make.
This to me maybe about an hour and fifteen minutes um your time and you use your time why they don't really much time takes about like you just mix everything mean ten minutes and then put them in twenty minutes i think and then you take it out during that time you consider yourself and do the feeling so no and a half an hour first but then after everything is cool and selling it made me take depending on how long you want to you know taking decorating and make it look nice maybe another twenty thirty minutes but altogether more than an hour depending on you know your skill and how fast do things but otherwise it's fairly simple little complicated but it's not at all how much.
Say a cake like this one car.
Uh probably a heated server um fifteen to twenty dollars i've actually seen more expensive like other stores um it's it's kinda sad that healthy things to be so expensive but like this we go even from fifteen to thirty dollars it's uh it's funny because it's healthy it's you know it has you know hurt your body you know you're gonna pay for it if you do at home you know it costs too much no more than maybe five or six dollars altogether italian.
Okay i was hoping you make the same exact cake that you made today and somebody was opening up the oven and you had your immediately told them not to do that why did you tell them not to do that.
Because what happens in the korean cooler go in and it will cause a cake too for like a and it's just like a in and that's not very very well so he has three and then when you're when you're making it will cause they can.
Why do you make your food vegan why don't you just um get ingredients the regular ingredients and just make your food um the normal way why began.
Very good question but it's also very simple questions we are called to do everything dies and we're living in the last the and is going to try to make an insult on upon our mind and the in our mind and if we do not eat health food and keep our body fit be weak online will not be able to make rational and correct decision and that is one of the major reasons why i eat only began because it seems that when i eat and other things that are have been contaminated such dairy in the middle and i'm a meat meat products all it does is of my system i cannot think properly and i cannot be able to communicate with my lord and savior so it's very important that nutritious foods that isn't abundant in all the vitamins and minerals that i'm from my body and i get the carbohydrates and the protein and when i get this balance nutrition that is a a found owning a vegetables then my body will feel great and i feel great and do the rest of the in my mind is clear i mean and be able to discern spiritual thing because your health is when when you are healthy are you able to discern spiritual things because your mind will not be though will be clear and the holy spirit communicate but if it's that's why it's very important to see if your mind and your body all services it may be able to teach you use.
