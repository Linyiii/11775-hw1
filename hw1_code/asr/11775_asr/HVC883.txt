So really our camping to town.
Uh.
The size of that honest to god that seems and then it extends beyond that.
It even gets better because they're going into one of the smaller states here they already had to break a bunch of branches off the trees just to make the trailer.
I think they're just gonna have to dismantle that together then.
Why i don't think it'll be five when they in.
